Things are looking up
I've been looking the landscape over
And it's covered with four-leaf clover
Most things are looking up since love looked up at me

Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner
Oh, things are looking up since love looked up at me
See the sunbeams
Every one beams
Just because of you
Love's in session
And my depression
Is unmistakeably through

Things are looking up
It's a great little world we live in
Oh, I'm happy as a pup
Since love looked up at me
