Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition
Depends on you
I never mind
The rain from the skies
If I can find
The sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you
It's 'cause I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you
Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition
Depends on you
I never mind
The rain from the skies
If I can find
The sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you
It's 'cause I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with
I'm happy when I'm with
So happy when I'm with
I'm happy when I'm with you
