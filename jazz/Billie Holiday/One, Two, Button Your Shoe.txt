One, two, button your shoe
Put on your coat and hat
I play a game like that
While I'm waiting for you

Three, four, open the door
Hurry, for heaven's sake
I count each step you take
While I'm waiting for you
Five, six, my heart does tricks
As I picture all your charms
Seven, eight, you're at the gate
And you walk into my arms

Nine, ten, kiss me again
Tell me you get a thrill
Just as I hope you will
While I'm waiting for you

Five, six, my heart does tricks
As I picture all your charms
Seven, eight, you're at the gate
And you walk into my arms

Nine, ten, kiss me again
Tell me you'll get a thrill
Just as I hope you will
While I'm waiting for you
