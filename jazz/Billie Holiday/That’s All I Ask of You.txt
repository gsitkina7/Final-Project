You've heard my story before
I've often told it you know
Well, it's just the same
A dream that's been in vain
Someone to miss when I'm away
Someone to kiss at close of day
A heart that's new with a love that's true
That's all I ask of you
Someone to care when things look blue
A love to share my whole life through
We're side by side, just a groom and a bride
That's all I ask of you
Now most of my plans have crumbled and faded
May this one come true
I'll make a start, I'll give you my hart
The rest is up to you
So give your love in one sweet kiss
I ask no more of you than this
Be sweet and kind, say that you'll be mine
That's all I ask of you
Now most of my plans have crumbled and faded
May this one come true
I'll make a start, I'll give you my hart
The rest is up to you
So give your love in one sweet kiss
I ask no more of you than this
Be sweet and kind, say that you'll be mine
That's all I ask of you
