No regrets
Although our love affair has gone astray
No regrets
I know I'll always care though you're away
So now our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine
No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart, no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets
No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart, no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets
