I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
'cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So what's the use, you've cooked my goose
'cause you took advantage of me
I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
'cause you took advantage of me
