Music everywhere, feet are pattin'
Puttin' tempo in old Manhattan
Everybody is out high-hattin'
Spreadin' the rhythm around
Everywhere you go trumpets are blarin'
Drums and saxophones rip and tearin'
Everybody you meet is rarin'
Spreadin' the rhythm around
Up in Harlem in every flat they give it that zing
Which according to one and all is what they call swing
Those who can't afford silk and satin
Dance with gigolos who are latin
Come from Yonkers, the Bronx and Staten
Spreadin' the rhythm around
