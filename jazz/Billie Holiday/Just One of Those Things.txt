It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things
It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to moon on gossamer wings, just one of those things
If we'd thought a bit of the end of it when we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair was too hot not to cool down
So, goodbye, dear, and amen! Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun, but it was just one of those things!
