A sailboat in the moonlight and you
Wouldn't that be heaven, a heaven just for two
A soft breeze on a June night and you
What a perfect setting for letting dreams come true

A chance to sail away to Sweetheart Bay
Beneath the stars that shine
A chance to drift, for you to lift
Your tender lips to mine
The things, dear, that I long for are few
Just give me a sailboat in the moonlight and you
A chance to sail away to Sweetheart Bay
Beneath the stars that shine
A chance to drift, for you to lift
Your tender lips to mine
The things, dear, that I long for are few
Just give me a sailboat in the moonlight and you
