There ain't nothing I can do
Or nothing I can say
Just what I want to anyway
And I don't care just what people may say
And if I, if I take a notion
The jump-off into the ocean
Ain't nobody's business if I do
And if I go to church on Sunday
Then cabaret all day Monday
It ain't nobody's business if I do
If my baby ain't got no money
And I say take all of mine honey
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I give my baby my last nickle, O
And it leaves me, leaves me in a pickle
It ain't nobody's business if I do
I'd rather from my baby to hit me
Then to jump off and quit me
Ain't nobody's business if I do
Nobody's business if I do
