The weather is frightening
The thunder and lighting
Seem to having their way
But as far as I'm concerned it's a lovely day
The change in the weather
Will keep us together
So as far as I'm concerned it's a lovely day
And every thing's OK
Isn't it a lovely day to be caught in the rain
You were going on your way now you have to remain
Just as you were leaving me (out to) (at) sea
The clouds broke and Oh what a break for me
I can see the sun up high though we're caught in a storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter-patter
Cause it really doesn't matter
If skies are gray
Long as I can be you it's a lovely day
