My life was empty when you went away
Even the blue skies above had turned gray
But now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
Those little quarrels that tore us apart
Oh, gee, I can see they were wrong from the start
But now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
I can't seem to see what you see in my
I guess love is really blind
The world seems so grand now that you understand
It's you I adore, it's you I live for
Life is sublime now that you're here with me
Please keep it in mind, dear, and don't stray from me
For now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
I can't seem to see what you see in my
I guess love is really blind
This world seems so grand now that you understand
It's you I adore, it's you I live for
Life is sublime now that you're here with me
Please keep it in mind, dear, and don't stray from me
For now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
