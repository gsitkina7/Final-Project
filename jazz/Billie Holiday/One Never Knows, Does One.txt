One never knows, does one?
When love will come along
Then so suddenly
Life turns out to be a song

One never knows, does one?
The moment or the place
Then right before your eyes
Someone occupies your embrace
Someday look and you'll find
Two hearts were blest
Someday fate may be kind
Pray for the future, hope for the best

One never knows, does one?
That's just the way it goes
All at once you hear
"Hold me, caress me" and then
Love may come, but when, one never knows

Someday look and you'll find
Two hearts were blest
Someday fate may be kind
Pray for the future, hope for the best

One never knows, does one?
That's just the way it goes
All at once you hear
"Hold me, caress me" and then
Love may come, but when, one never knows
Does one?
