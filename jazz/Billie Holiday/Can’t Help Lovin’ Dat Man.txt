Fish got to swim and birds got to fly
I got to love one man till I die
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow
Tell me I'm crazy; maybe, I know
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

When he goes away
That's a rainy day
And when he comes back that day is fine
The sun will shine
He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
