With thee I swing, baby
With thee it's just not dancing
To thee I cling, baby
Whenever I get a chance

With thee I swing, baby
For thou art so entrancin'
My heart goes bing, baby
Whenever we start to dance
With all the others I'm only marking time
But in your arms I melt away
Like ice cream on a summer's day

Just one more thing, baby
My life won't be worthwhile
'Till down the middle aisle
With thee I swing
