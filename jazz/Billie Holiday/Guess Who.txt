Somebody thrills to the skies
When she looks in your eyes
Guess who? guess who?
Somebody longs to be part
Of the song in your heart
Guess who? guess who?
Whose heart is sure to melt like butter
The moment that you utter
"I do", "I do"
Oh it's as plain as can be
That that someone is me
So you don't have to guess who
