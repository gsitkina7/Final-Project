You're a lucky guy when you consider
The highest bidder can't buy
The gleam in your eyes
You're a lucky guy
Thank you lucky stars
You've got a honey who wants no money
She'll take you just as you are
Thank you lucky stars
Hey fellow, say fellow
Don't you realise it's fated, you rated
Open up your eyes
You're lucky guy
You're just beginning so have your inning
And let your troubles boom by
No one can deny you're a lucky guy
Hey fellow, say fellow
Look at Mr. Jones
He's there and he's staring
Even he must know
You're a lucky guy
So why not treasure your highest pleasure
And live right up till you die
No one can deny boy
You're a lucky guy
