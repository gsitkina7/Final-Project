Deep rhythm captivates me
Hot rhythms stimulates me
Can't help but swing it, boy
Swing it, brother, swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on swing me, boys
Swing it, brother, swing
Raring to go
And there ain't nobody gonna hold me down
Say listen, boy
Hurry up and send me, let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on kill me, boys
Swing it, brother, swing
Deep rhythms captivate me
Hot rhythm stimulates me
Can't help but swing it, boy
Swing it, brother, swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on kill me, boys
Swing it, brother, swing
Raring to go
And there ain't nobody gonna hold me down
Say listen, boy
Hurry up and send me, let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on knock me out
Swing it, brother, swing
Swing, brother swing
