More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I've found you on my mind
More than you know
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so
More than you'll ever know
Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But darling, I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry
How I'd sigh
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I show
More than you'll ever know
