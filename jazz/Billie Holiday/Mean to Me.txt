You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why!

I stay home each night
When you say you'll phone
You don't and I'm left all alone
Singin' the blues and sighin'
You treat me coldly
Each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear

It must be
Great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me?
