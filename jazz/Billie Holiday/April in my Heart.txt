There's snowflakes in the sky
And geese are flying high
But it's April in my heart again
The devil's got his due
Love's holiday is through
Love and I have made a happy start again
Though leaves lie on the ground
The world just turned around
It isn't Fall at all, you see, It's Spring that I have found
There's frost in Central Park
At five it's almost dark
What's the difference when you've heard love's sweet amend?
There's snowflakes in the sky
And geese are flying high
But there's April in my heart again
