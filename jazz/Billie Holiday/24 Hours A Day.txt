Like a little old fashioned music box
With just one tune to play
My heart keeps singin' I love you
Twenty four hours a day
Like a little old fashioned music box
That skips a note or two
My heart keeps missin' a heart beat
Singin' its song about you
And although the song we know is old
It's still the sweetest story ever told
