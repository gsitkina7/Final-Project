Sun showers
Never mind the rain, the sun will shine again
Through sun showers
In a little while the sky above will smile
Like laughter that follows your tears
Dark clouds of sorrow
Will soon be a sunny tomorrow

While sun flowers
Raise their happy eyes up to the flaming skies
Then sun showers
Leave us as they follow rainbows in our hearts
The grey sky soon will clear, my dear
While sun showers are here
