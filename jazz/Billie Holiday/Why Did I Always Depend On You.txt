Why did I always depend on you
When I knew that you'd end in another's arms?
As a rule I'm no fool
But it seems where love's concerned
There's no rule for a fool
Who would let his heart be burned
And you intended to fool me too
That's no lie and you can't deny it's true
From the start in my heart
I knew what you'd do
Why did I depend on you?
And you intended to fool me too
That's no lie and you can't deny it's true
From the start in my heart
I knew what you'd do
Why did I depend on you?
