I'll get by
As long as I have you
Oh there'be rain
And darkness too
I'll not complain
I'll live with you
Poverty
May come to me that's true
But what care I
I'll get by
As long as I have you
I'll get by as long as I have you
Though there'll be rain and darkness too
I'll not complain
I'll laugh, it's true
Ah, but tears may come to me
That's true
But what care I, say
I'll get by, as long as I have you
