There's something rules our destiny
Right from the first day of our birth
Altough you may not care for me
You have your mission on this earth

You were born to love, sure as you live
Born with everything heaven could give
You have eyes and they express love at a glance
You have lips whose tenderness speaks of romance
Like a dream of love, lovely to see
You're the angel of my destiny
And to think that you have found your place on earth only to be
Born to love and be loved by me

Like a dream of love, lovely to see
You're the angel of my destiny
And to think that you have found your place on earth only to be
Born to love and be loved by me
