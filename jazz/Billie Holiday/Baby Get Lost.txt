Well good morning baby welcome back to town
How'd, fine papa, welcome back to town
You're doing so much travelling never know
When you'll be around
You're a fine and mellow fellow
But you're stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel
But you treat me like a fool
Two-faced daddy don't hand me no doublecross
You'll see any time I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost
You're cheating on the outside
Doing anything you choose
You better come back on the inside
'Cause you got too much to lose
Don't want no trouble I've got to be the boss
And if you can't play it my way
Well now baby get lost
I try to stop your cheating
But I just don't have the time
'Cause I got so many men that
They're standing right in line
Keep cool papa, you got to corne across
'Cause any time I'm ready, yes any time I'm ready
You know when I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost
Why don't you get lost
