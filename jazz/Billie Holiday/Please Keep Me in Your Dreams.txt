Please, keep me in your dreams
In your sweet dreams let me hold you
When through your window
The breeze comes swingin'
It's just bringin' this love song that I'm singin'

Please, keep me in your dreams
My kiss, it seems, must have told you
My heart you'll borrow until tomorrow
So, please, keep me in your dreams
Please, keep me in your dreams
In your sweet dreams let me hold you
When through your window
The breeze comes swingin'
It's just bringin' this love song that I'm singin'

Please, keep me in your dreams
My kiss, it seems, must have told you
My heart you'll borrow until tomorrow
So, please, keep me in your dreams
