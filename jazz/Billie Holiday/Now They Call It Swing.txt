Once they called it ragtime
And it had its fling
It's the same old syncopation
Now they call it swing

Then they played it jazz time
To a buck-and-wing
Once again it sweeps the nation
Now they call it swing
When singers used to sing
They would go: "Hot-cha!"
But with this modern thing
Now they go: "Dri-di-dit-ti dra-da-dat"

Rhythm has its seasons
Summer, fall and spring
But for seven silly reasons
Someone pulled the string
And they started dancing
Now they call it swing

Once they called it ragtime
And it had its fling
It's the same old syncopation
Now they call it swing

Then they played it jazz time
To a buck-and-wing
Once again it sweeps the nation
Now they call it swing
When singers used to sing
They would go: "Hot-cha!"
But with this modern thing
Now they go: "Dri-ti-tit tra-ta-ta"

Rhythm has its seasons
Summer, fall and spring
But for seven silly reasons
Someone pulled the string
And they started dancing
Now they call it swing

Baby, now they call it swing
