I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always, always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always
I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand will understand
Always, always
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always
