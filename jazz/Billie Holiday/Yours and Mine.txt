The stars that shine
Are yours and mine
The rainbows in the sky
Are yours and mine
The song of springtime
The lullaby of Fall
The sunshine of summertime
Belongs to us all

The moon above
Is yours and mine
The right to fall in love
Is yours and mine
The hope of finding the dream
Our hearts design
All this is yours and mine
