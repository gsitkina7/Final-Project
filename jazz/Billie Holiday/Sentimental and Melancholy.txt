Sentimental and melancholy
Whenever I think about you
It's only a mood, a brief interlude
That's better described as just feeling blue

I suppose that it's just my folly
To keep it alive as I do
But it's a kind of sugar-coated misery
And, foolish as it seems, I sorta like to be
Sentimental and melancholy
Whenever I think about you
