A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Shy little he and she
Were declaring love's old story
In the shade of the old apple tree,,
A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Decided to say, "i do"
So they rode to june and glory
On a bicycle built for two
Hear the past. the song is old
The summer days are through
With silver threads among the gold
They still say, "I love you"
A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Are true to this very day
For he loves her in december
As he did in may
