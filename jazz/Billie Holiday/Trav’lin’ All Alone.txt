I'm so weary and all alone
Feel all tired like heavy stone
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

Who will see and who will care
'Bout this load that I must bear?
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

Prayers I sent to heaven above
'Bout my burdens, woes and love
Head bowed down with misery
Nothin' now appeals to me
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
Give me just another day
There's one thing I want to say
Friends do well when all is gold
Leave you always when you're old
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
All alone
