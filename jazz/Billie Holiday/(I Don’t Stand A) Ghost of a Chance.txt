I need your love so badly
I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I found you
But other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
If you'd surrender
Just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover meant for you
And I'll be true
But what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
If you'd surrender
Just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover meant for you
And I'll be true
But what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
