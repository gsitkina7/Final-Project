I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes
And you have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm fallin', no stallin'
In a great big way for you
My heart is jumpin', you've started somethin'
With them there eyes
You better look out lil brown eyes...if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
Oh baby...them there eyes
I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
You have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
Fallin', no stallin'
In a great big way for you
My heart is jumpin', you've started somthin'
With them there eyes
You better look out lil brown eyes, if you're wise
Sparkle
Bubble
Get you in a whole lot of trouble..
I'm lookin for the boy with the whisful eyes

With them there eyes
