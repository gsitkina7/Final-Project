When the moon's kinda dreamy
Starry eyed and dreamy
And nights are luscious and long
If you're kinda lonely
And all by your only
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

When the wind through the willow
Blows across your pillow
And tells you sleepin' is wrong
If love goes a thirstin'
Till you feel like burstin'
Then nothing but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'
Suppose you want somebody
But you ain't got nobody
You only got a gleam in your eye
Till somebody's found you
And puts their lovin' arms around you
You got the feelin' you want to die

But when the Lord up above you
Sends someone to love you
The blues are something you lose
You're so busy doin'
The things that you're doing'
That love ain't got no time
For brewin' the blues


But when the Lord up above you
Sends someone to love you
The blues are something you lose
You're so busy doin'
The things that you're doing'
That love ain't got no time
For brewin' the blues
The blues
