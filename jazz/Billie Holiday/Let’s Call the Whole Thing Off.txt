You say either and I say either
You say neither and I say neither
Either, either, neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off

You like potatoes and I like potatoes
You like tomatoes and I like tomatoes
Potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes
Let's call the whole thing off
But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part
Then that might break my heart

So if you like pajamas and I like pajamas
I'll wear pajamas and give up pajamas
For we know we need each other, so we'd
Better call the calling off, off
Let's call the whole thing off


You say laughter and I say laughter
You say after and I say after
Laughter, laughter
After, after
Let's call the whole thing off

You like vanilla and I like vanilla
You saspiralla, and I saspirella
Vanilla, vanilla, chocolate strawberry
Let's call the whole thing off
But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part
Then that might break my heart

So if you go for oysters and I go for oysters
I'll order oysters and cancel the oysters
For we know we need each other, so we'd
Better call the calling off, off
Let's call the whole thing off
