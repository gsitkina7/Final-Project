I'll never be the same
Skies have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothin's what it once used to be

And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
I'll never be the same
Since we're apart

But there's a lot that a smile can hide
And I know deep down inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again
