I hadn't anyone till you
I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me
Now I see I had to save my love for you
I never gave my love till you
And thru my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you
