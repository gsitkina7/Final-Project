Homesick, tired, all alone in a big city
Why should eveybody pity me?
Nighttime falling, and I'm yearning for Virginia
Hospitality within ya calls me
Pale moon shining on the fields below
Folks are crooning songs soft and low
Need not tell me so
Because I know it's sleepy time down south
Softs winds blowing thru the pinewood trees
Folks down there live a life of ease
When the twilight brings the evening breeze
It's sleepy time down south
Steamboats on the river, a coming, a going
Splashing the night away
Hear those banjos ringing
The folks are all singing
They dance till break of day
Dear old Southland with its dreamy songs
Takes back there where I belong
I'll find heaven in my mothers arms
When it's sleepy time down south
