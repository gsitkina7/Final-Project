My first impression of you
Was like the sight of flowers in spring
You were a glorious thing to see

My first impression of you
Was something indescribably new
I stood there looking at you smiling at me

If you had stepped right out of heaven
It wouldn't surprise me more
I thought you were an angel from heaven's door
It may sound silly but true
My heart just stopped when I caught your eye
So overwhelming was my first impression of you
