I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
I wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April days that would not dance away
I wished on a star
To throw me a beam or two
I begged on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you

I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April days that would not dance away
I wished on a star
To throw me a beam or two
I begged on a star
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon
Wished on the moon
Wished on the moon for you
