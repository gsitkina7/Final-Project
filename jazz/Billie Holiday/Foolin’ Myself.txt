I tell myself: "I'm through with love
And I'll have nothing more to do with love"
I stay away
But every day
I'm just foolin' myself

I tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But they all know
It isn't so
I'm just foolin' myself
And every time I turn
And see myself in the looking glass
I tip my hat and say:
"How do you do, you fool? You're throwin' your life away!"

I'm acting gay, I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just foolin' myself
