What shall I say
When our neighbours want us to come to tea?
They don't know you're not with me
What shall I say?
What shall I say
When the phone rings and someone asks for you
They don't know I ask for you too
What shall I say?
How can I hide the tears inside
How can I face the crowd?
I can,make lips of mine be still
But my heart sighs too loud
I could explain that
You're only gone for a walk to shop
But after the week is up
What shall I say?
