You don't have to have a hanker
To be a broker or a banker
No siree, just simply be
My mother's son-in-law
Needn't even think of tryin'
To be a mighty social lion
Sipping tea, if you'll be
My mother's son-in-law
Ain't got the least desire
To set the world on fire
Just wish you'd make it proper
To call my old man papa
You don't have to sing like Bledsoe
You can tell the world I said so
Can't you see you've got to be
My mother's son-in-law
You don't have to sing like Jessel
You can tell the world I said so
Can't you see, you've got to be
My mother's son-in-law
