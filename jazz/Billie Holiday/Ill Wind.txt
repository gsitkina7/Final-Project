Blow
Ill wind blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
No good
Go
Ill wind go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood
And that's no good
You're only misleading
The sunshine I'm needing
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up
With troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When love's to blame
So
Ill wind blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
No good
No good
You're only misleading
The sunshine I'm needing
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up
With troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When love's to blame
So
Ill wind go away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
No good
Ill wind
