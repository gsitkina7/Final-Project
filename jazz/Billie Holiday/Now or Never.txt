Hey fat daddy make up your mind
'Cause I've been waiting such a long, long time
Now baby or never 'cause I been so good to you
Now baby or never 'cause I've been so lonesome, too
Now baby or never if I mean anything to you
Now baby or never 'cause you wasted so much time
Now baby or never 'cause you can't make up your mind
Now baby or never and it ain't no fault of mine
It's got to
