Never dared to have your arms around me
Not that I considered it a sin
But tonight I want your arms around me
It's the mood that I'm in

Can it be the music that they're playin'
Or the magic of the violin
That intrigues my heart into obeyin'?
It's the mood that I'm in
Maybe it's the cocktail that I'm sippin'
That helps to put me in this frame of mind
Maybe it's because of you I'm slippin'
Tonight I'm so romantically inclined!

So speak to me of love in words so tender
Let the rhapsody of life begin
I could give my heart in sweet surrender
It's the mood I'm in
