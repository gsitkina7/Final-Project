You're so desirable
I just can't resist you
You're so desirable
I have to give in
That tirm resolve I made
Has vanished away now
I'm happy to say now
You win
You're so adorable
The moment I saw you
It's just deplorable
The fool that I've been
And yet I'm glad
You've got my heart dear
Like a butterfly on a pin
You're so desirable
I had to give in
