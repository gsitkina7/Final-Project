I cried last night
I cried all the night before
I cried last night
I cried all the night before
I cried my eyes this morning
And I ain't go to cry no more
I will climb these mountains
If is the last thing I do
I will climb these mountains
If is the last thing I do
And when I climb these rocky mountains
There'll be no more crying over you
You said you'd be my lover
And you promised to be true
Well I took you for my lover
And you broke my heart in two
You broke a promise
Each kiss you gave was lie
But I'll climb these rocky mountains
If I don't I hope to die
Someday you'll be sad and lonely
And you'll want to come to me
Yes, some day you'd be lonely
And you'll want to come to me
I'll be hide on these mountains
Gaze and caught the deep blues
Woohee mountains
Yes you'll rock all the way
Woohee mountains
You'll rock all the way
But if I leave and nothing happens
I reach the tops on sunny day
