Moanin' low, my sweet man, I love him so
Though he's mean as can be
He's the kind of man
Needs the kind of a woman like me

Gonna die if my sweet man should pass me by
If I die, where'll he be?
He's the kind of a man
Needs the kind of a woman like me
Don't know any reason why he treats me so poorly
What have I gone and done?
Makes my trouble double with his worries, when surely
I ain't deservin' of none

Moanin' low, my sweet man is gonna go
When he goes, oh Lordy
He's the kind of a man
Needs the kind of a woman like me
