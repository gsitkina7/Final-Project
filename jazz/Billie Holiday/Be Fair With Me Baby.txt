I'm helpless without you baby
I've almost lost my mind
Yes, helpless without you baby
I've almost lost my mind
I'm blue and confused
Since you left me behind
My friends all know it baby
The tears I cannot hide
My friends all know it baby
The tears I cannot hide
You changed your disposition
And thrown my love aside
Be fair with me baby
I
Please be fair with me baby
Our love can't start anew
I'm blue and helpless baby
And I'm worried over you
Yes, I'm worried
I've got the helpless blues
