Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do?
If it's a crime than I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you
Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you
What can I do
What can I say
After I take on the blame
You say you're through
You'll go your way but I'll always feel just the same
Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If thats a crime than I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you
