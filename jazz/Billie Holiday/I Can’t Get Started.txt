I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you
You're so supreme
Lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream day and night of you
Scheme just for a sight of you
Baby, but what good does it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D
Robert Taylor has had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you
When first we met
How you elated me pet
You devastated me, yet
Now you've deflated me
'Til, you're my Waterloo
When J.P. Morgan bows I just nod
Green Pastures wanted me to play God
The Siamese twins I've parted
Can't get started with you
