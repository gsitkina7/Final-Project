Yankee Doodle never went to town
I just discovered the story was phoney
Let me give you all the real lowdown
He didn't even own a pony
He was really very short and fat
While in the story so skinny and moany
And so hungry that he ate his hat
And called the feather macaroni
Underneath the chestnut tree
He and the blacksmith would sip their tea
Then he'd bring out his zither for an old lowdown
That's how he went to town
Yankee Doodle tried to leave one day
Took his belongings and mounted his saddle
But he never started on his way
Cause he didn't have a pony
And the fairy tale is phoney
How could Yankee Doodle go to town?
