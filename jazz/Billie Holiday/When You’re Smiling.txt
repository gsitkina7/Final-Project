When you're smiling, when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughing, when you're laughing
The sun comes shining through

But when you're crying you bring on the rain
So stop your sighing, be happy again
Keep on smiling, 'cause when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you
