When we're in a friendly situation
My conversation may not be smart
But if we're to have a perfect understanding
Let's call a heart a heart
There are words that should be whispered gent@y
That's evidently the way to start
If I tell you what my dreams have been demanding
Let's call a heart a heart
Can I prove how I yearn
Just by the turn of a phrase
Can I keep my control
When all my soul is aflame
Maybe we'd call a true confession
And in discretion on someone's part
But if I'm to say how madly I adore you
Let's call a heart a heart
