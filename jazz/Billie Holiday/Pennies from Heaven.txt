Oh, every time it rains
It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know, each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven

You'll find your fortune fallin'
All over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers

So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me
