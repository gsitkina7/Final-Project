Fall in love, fall in love
Says my heart
It's romance, take a chance
Says my heart
But each time that I'm
Almost in your arms
This old schoolteacher brain of mine
Keeps bringing in false alarms
Then my head rolls instead
And I'm wise
To the scheme of that gleam
In your eyes
So I kiss and run
But the moment we're apart
"Oh! you fool, that was love"
Says my heart
Then my head rolls instead
And I'm wise
To the scheme of that gleam
In your eyes
So I kiss and run
But the moment we're apart
"Oh! you fool, that was love"
Says my heart
It wasn't the moon, it wasn't the stars
"That was love!", says my heart
