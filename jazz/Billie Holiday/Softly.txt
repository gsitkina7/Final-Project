Softly, baby
Softly, baby
Take me in your arms
Oh, easy, baby
Easy, baby
As I sample your charms
Your lips little daddy
Are the doors to ecstasy
Let's not get excited
Love spark has ignited
Softly, Baby
Softly, baby
Whisper from you heart
Oh, love me baby
Love me baby
Make me yours from the start
Now I know myself
I'm willing to throw myself
On passion's path on the fly
Take it easy, baby
Softly, baby
I'll be yours by and by
Softly, baby
