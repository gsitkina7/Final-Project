'Cause he ain't got rhythm
Every night he sits in the house alone
'Cause he ain't got rhythm
Every night he sits there and wears a frown

He attracted some attention
When he found the fourth dimension
But he ain't got rhythm
So no one's with him, the loneliest man in town
Oh!, lonely man is he
Bending over his books
His wife and family
Keep giving him dirty looks

'Cause he ain't got rhythm
When they call him up it's to call him down
With that daring aviator
He encircled the equator
But he ain't got rhythm
So no one's with him, the loneliest man in town
