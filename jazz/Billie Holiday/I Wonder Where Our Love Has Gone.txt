All I know is that I'm in love with you
Even though you say that we are through
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone
Always thought you'd love me more and more
Never dreamed you'd ever let me go
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone
Oh what did I do, and what did I say
Never could lead you to treat me this way
If I've been untrue I'm willing to pay
Darling, if that's not enough I'll do anything you say
So darling, please, wherever you may be
Hear my plea, hurry home to me
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone
Oh what did I do, and what did I say
Never could lead you to treat me this way
If I've been untrue I'm willing to pay
Darling, if that's not enough I'll do anything you say
So darling, please, wherever you may be
Hear my plea, hurry back to me
I know without your love I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone
