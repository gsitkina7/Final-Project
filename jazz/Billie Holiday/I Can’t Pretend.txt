I can't pretend
I'm sorry we're apart
I can't pretend
I just can't fool my heart
Though I miss mine
My friends all seem to realize
They surmise
That look in my eyes
I can't pretend
I simply can't be gayer
For in the end
My tears give me away
Without you, dear, I live a lie
I can't defend
I love you
And I can't pretend
I can't pretend
I simply can't be gayer
For in the end
My tears give me away
Without you, dear, I live a lie
I can't defend
I love you
And I can't pretend
