I'll never fail you
Whatever may be
I'll never tail you
Depend upon me
I'll see them all through
The things you've planned
But if they fall through
I'll understand
And when shadows trail you
I'll bring you the sun
I'll never fail you
There's no other one
I'm yours forever
We never will part
I'll never never fail you sweetheart
