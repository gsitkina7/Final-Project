You can't be mine
And someone else's too
Someday you'll find
I've been a friend to you
I don't believe that life's worth living
I gave you all there was worth giving
You never cared how I fared or what I do
I called you mine but I was not to blame
For all the time you played up to
Hand and game
Second hand love I can't see
It's good for some but not for me
You can't be mine
And somene else's too
