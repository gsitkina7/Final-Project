Who loves you?
Ask yourself the question
Who loves you, sweetheart?
And tell me who thinks of you
A million times a day
And who's blue and lonely, honey
When you're away?

Say, who needs you
Needs you every minute?
Who fell for you from the start?
Oh, who just longs for your caresses?
You don't have to take three guesses
Who loves you, sweetheart?
