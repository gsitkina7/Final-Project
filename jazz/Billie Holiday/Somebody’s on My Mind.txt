Somebody's on my mind
Like an old sweet song, "The Lasting Time"
Somebody's on my mind
So I'm walking on clouds on a silver line
To dream my dream could be my mistake
But I'd rather be wrong
And sleep right along than wake
Love may be blind I'll take my chances
That it cares this affair, my real romance
That's why you'll find somebody's on my mind
