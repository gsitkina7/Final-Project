Sometimes I wonder what's in store for me
Your love could open heaven's door to me
But you don't care a straw for me
That's life, I guess

My days and nights are stark and hard with you
My sugar kisses taste like salt to you
But why should I find fault with you?
That's life, I guess
The world was bright when you loved me
Sweet was the touch of your lips
The world went dark when you left me
And then there came a total eclipse

Nobody knows how cruel fate can be
How close together love and hate can be
Goodbye, just clean the slate for me
That's life, I guess
