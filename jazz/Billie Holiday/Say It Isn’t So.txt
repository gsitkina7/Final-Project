Say it isn't so, say it isn't so
Ev'ryone is saying you don't love me
Say it isn't so
Ev'rywhere I go, ev'ryone I know
Whispers that you're growing tired of me
Say it isn't so
People say that you
Found somebody new
And it won't be long before you leave me
Say it isn't true
Say that ev'rything is still okay
That's all I want to know
And what they're saying
Say it isn't so
