I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Scheme a while, dream a while
You're sure to find happiness and, I guess
All those things you always pine for

Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Until that lucky day
You know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
