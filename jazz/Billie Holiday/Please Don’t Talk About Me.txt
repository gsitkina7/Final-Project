Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice
We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on (but I'll make it, baby!)
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Please don't talk about me, honey, when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all, is Jerry's advice
We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss, I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me, honey
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
