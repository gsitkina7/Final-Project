Like a ship at sea, I'm just lost in a fog
My mind is hazy, my thoughts are blue
Guess I'll always be kinda
Lost in a fog without you

Waitin' night and day like a bump on a log
I'm goin' crazy; what can I do?
Help me find my way
'Cause I'm lost in a fog without you
It was sunny every day
The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love
Only fools like me could be tossed in a bog
I've got a heartache I never knew
Guess I'll always be kinda
Lost in a fog without you
Like a ship at sea, I'm lost in a fog
My mind is hazy, my thoughts are blue
Guess I'll always be kinda
Lost in a fog without you

It was sunny every day
The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love
Only fools like me could be tossed in a bog
I've got a heartache I never knew
Guess I'll always be kinda
Lost in a fog without you
