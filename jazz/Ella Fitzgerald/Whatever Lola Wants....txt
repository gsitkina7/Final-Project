Whatever Lola wants
Lola gets
And little man, little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have
No regrets
Recline yourself, resign yourself, you're through
I always get what I aim for
And your heart'n soul is what I came for
Whatever Lola wants Lola gets
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win?
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in!...Give in!...Give in!
I always get what I aim for
And you heart'n soul is what I came for ...
Whatever Lola wants....
Whatever Lola wants...
Whatever Lola wants Lola gets
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win?
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in!...Give in!...Give in!
Lola wants ...
Lola gets ...
You'll never win I'm irresistible, you fool, Give in...Give in...Give in
