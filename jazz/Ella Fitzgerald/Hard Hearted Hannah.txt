In old Savannah, I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm!
The climates of a Southern brand
But here's what I don't understand:
They got a gal there, mighty pretty gal there
Who's colder than an Arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even the ice men leave her alone!
They call her Hard Hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town;
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em
Is her delight, they say
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!
They call her Hard Hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town;
Talk of your cold, refrigeratin' mamas
Brother, she's a polar bear's pajamas!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em
Is her delight, they say
An evening spent with Hannah sittin' on your knees
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!
Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name: The vamp of Savannah
Any time a woman can take a great big pan
And start pouring water on a drownin' man
She's hard hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah GA
