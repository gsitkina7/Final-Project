I'm flyin' high, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
(Fallin' just for you)
You caught my eye and I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Show me the ring and I'll jump right through
(Jump right through)

I used to travel single-o; we chanced to mingle-o
Now I'm a-tingle over you
(Tingle over you)
Hey, Mister Parson, stand by, for I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
Doo, doo, doo-doo-doo
You flew too high, and now you got a feelin' you're fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
Said you caught my eye (And I've got a feelin' you're fallin')
Show me the ring and I'll jump right through

I used to travel single-o; we chanced to mingle-o
Now I'm a-tingle over you

Hey, Mister Parson, stand by, for I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
(You're fallin') Yes, I'm fallin'
(Just fallin') I'm still fallin' for nobody else but you
