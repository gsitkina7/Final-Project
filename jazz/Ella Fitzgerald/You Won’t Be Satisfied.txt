You won't be satisfied until you break my heart
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start
I tried to shower you with lovin' kisses
But all I ever get from you is naggin' & braggin'
My poor heart is raggin'
The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart
You won't be satisfied until you break my heart
The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same
You're only happy tearin' all of my dreams apart
Unless you hurt me and you'd know that I'd cried
It doesn't seem as though you'll ever be satisfied
