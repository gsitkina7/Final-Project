Oh listen, sister
I love my mister man
And I can't tell yo' why
Dere ain't no reason
Why I should love dat man
It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan
Refrain:
Fish got to swim, birds got to fly
I got to love one man till I die
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know)
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine
When he goes away
Dat's a rainy day
But when he comes back dat day is fine
De sun will shine!
He kin come home as late as kin be
Home widout him ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine
