Knock me a kiss, hey baby
Knock me a kiss
I mean, maybe, that's what
I want from you, really, baby, honey
I like cake and no mistake
But baby, if you insist
I'll cut out cake just for your sake
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss
I like pie, I hope to die
Just get a load of this
When you get high, dog, gone the pie
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss
When you pressed your lips to mine
'Twas, then I understood
They taste like candy, brandy and wine
Peaches, bananas and everything good
I love jam and no flim flam
Scratch that off of my list
There's ain't no jam, the jam can scram
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss
I like cars and big cigars
But baby they won't me missed
If everyday I hear you say
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss
I crave sights like Title fights
But if you should insist
I'd cancel nights at Title fights
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss
Yes, it's wise to compromise
In such cases as this
There's nothing worth the light in your eyes
What can compare with the thrill of your kiss
Scotch and rye are tops with me
But I promise this
If you say so, I'll drink ice tea
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss
Oh baby, oh baby
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss
