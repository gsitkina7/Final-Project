If I am fancy free
And love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul
There's something calling me
From way out yonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

I've got to give vent to my emotions
I'm only content having my way
There is no other life
Of which I'm fonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

No cares
No strings
My heart has wings

There is no other life
Of which I'm fonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

If I am fancy free
And I love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul
There's something calling me
From way out yonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

I've got to give vent to my emotions
I'm only content having my way
If I am fancy free
And love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul
There's something calling me
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
It's just the Gypsy in my soul
