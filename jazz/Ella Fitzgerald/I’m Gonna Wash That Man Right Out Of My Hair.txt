I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair
And send him on his way
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms
And send him on his way
Don't try to patch it up
Tear it up, tear it up!
Wash him out, dry him out
Push him out, fly him out
Cancel him and let him go!
Yea, sister!
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair
And send him on his way
If a man don't understand you
If you fly on separate beams
Waste no time, make a change
Ride that man right off your range
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams
Oho! If you laugh at different comics
If you root for different teams
Waste no time, weep no more
Show him what the door is for
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams
You can't light a fire when the woods are wet
No!
You can't make a butterfly strong
Hmm, hmm!
You can't fix an egg when it ain't quite good
And you can't fix a man when he's wrong!
You can't put back a petal when it falls from a flower
Or sweeten up a fellow when he starts turnin' sour
Oh no! Oh no!
If his eyes get dull and fishy
When you look for glints and gleams
Waste no time
Make a switch
Drop him in the nearest ditch!
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams
Oho! Oho!
I went to wash that man right outa my hair
I went to wash that man right outa my hair
I went to wash that man right outa my hair
And sent him on his way
She went to wash that man right outa my hair
She went to wash that man right outa my hair
She went to wash that man right outa my hair
And send him on his way!
