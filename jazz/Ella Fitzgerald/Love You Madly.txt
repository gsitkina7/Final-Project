Love you madly
Right or wrong
Sounds like the lyric of a song
But since it's so
I thought you ought to know
I love you
Love you madly
'Better fish are in the sea'
Is not the theory for me
And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you
Love you madly
If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring that makes me sing
My love song so loudly
Good things come to those who wait
So just relax and wait for fate
To let me see the day you say with me
'I love you
Love you madly.'
And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you
Love you madly
If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly
To let me see the day you say with me
'I love you madly.'
Love you madly right or wrong sounds like the lyric of a song
But since it's so
I thought you out to know
I love you madly
Better fish are in the sea
Is not the theory for me
And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you madly
If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly
Good things come to those who wait
So just relax and wait for fate
To let me see the day you say with me
'I love you
Love you madly.'
I love you
Love you, madly
I love you madly
Oh, I got big eyes for you baby
