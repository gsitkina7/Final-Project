Oh, do you know the Muffin Man?
The Muffin Man, the Muffin Man
Do you know the Muffin Man
Who dwells in Drury Lane?
Oh, yes, I know the Muffin Man
The Muffin Man, the Muffin Man
Yes, I know the Muffin Man
Who dwells in Drury Lane
He's never in a hurry
Never has a worry
Bringin' joy to everyone
Then he knows his work is done
Oh, you should know the Muffin Man
The Muffin Man, the Muffin Man
You should know the Muffin Man
Who dwells in Drury Lane
