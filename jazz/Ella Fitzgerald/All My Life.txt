All my life I've been waiting for you
My wonderful one
I've begun living all my life
All my love has been waiting for you
My life is sublime
Now that I'm giving all my love
You seem so lovely, so far above me
I'm almost afraid to look
But I adore you, I pledge before you
A heart that's an open book
All my life hold me close to your heart
But all else above
Hold my love, darling, just hold my love
