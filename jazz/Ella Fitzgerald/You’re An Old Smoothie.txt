You're an old smoothie, I'm an old softie
I'm just like putty in the hands of a boy like you
You're an old meanie, I'm a big boobie
I just go nutty in the hand of a boy like you
Poor me, you played me for a sap
Poor you, you thought you'd laid a trap
Well dear, I think it's time you knew
You've done just what I wanted you to
Silly old smoothie, crafty old softie
I'll stick like putty to the hand of a boy like you
Poor me, you played me for a sap
Poor you, you thought you'd laid a trap
Well dear, I think it's time you knew
You've done just what I wanted you to
Silly old smoothie, crafty old softie
I'll stick like putty to the hand of a boy like you
I just go nutty in the hand of a boy like you
