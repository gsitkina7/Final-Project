Oh, there's a lull in my life
It's just a void, an empty space
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull in my life
The moment that you go away
There is no night, there is no day
The world stops turning, the clock stops ticking
Everything stops but that flame in my heart
That keeps burning, burning
Oh, there's a lull in my life
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can end
The ache in my heart, the call of my arms
I know that you alone can end
The ache in my heart, the call of my arms
And the lull, lull in my life
