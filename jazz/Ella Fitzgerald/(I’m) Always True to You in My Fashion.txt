If a custom tailored vet
Asks me out for something wet
When the vet begins to pet--i cry hooray
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
I've been asked to have a meal
By a big tycoon in steel
If the meal includes a deal, accept I may
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
There's an oil man known as tex
Who is keen to give me checks
And his checks, I fear, means that tex is here to stay
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
From ohio mister thorn
Calls me up from night till morn
Mister thorn once cornered corn and that ain't hay
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
From milwaukee mister fritz
Often dines me at the ritz
Mister fritz invented schlitz and schlitz must pay
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
Mister harris, plutocrat, wants to give my cheek a pat
If the harris pat means a paris hat, pay, pay!
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
