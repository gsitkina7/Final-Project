Don't mind telling you, in my humble fash'
That you thrill me through, with a tender pash'
When you said you care, imagine my emosh'
I swore then and there, permanent devosh'
You made all other men seem blah
Just you alone filled me with ah

's wonderful, 's marvelous
You should care for me
's awful nice, 's paradise
's what I love to see
You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous
Oh, 's wonderful, 's marvelous
That you should care for me


's magnifique, 's what I seek
You should care for me
's elegant, 's what I want
's what I love to see

My dear, it's four-leaf clover time
From now on my heart's working overtime
's exceptional, 's no bagatelle
That you should care for
That you should care for
That you should care for me
