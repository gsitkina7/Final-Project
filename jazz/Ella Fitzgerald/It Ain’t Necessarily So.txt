It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
De t'ings dat yo li'ble
To read in de Bible -
It ain't necessarily so
Li'l' david was small, but oh my!
Li'l' david was small, but oh my!
He fought big goliath
Who lay down and dieth -
Li'l' david was small, but oh my!
Yeah!
Oh jonah, he lived in de whale
Oh jonah, he lived in de whale
Fo' he made his home in
Dat fish's abdomen -
Oh jonah, he lived in de whale
L'il' moses was found in a stream
L'il' moses was found in a stream
He floated on water
'till ole' pharaoh's daughter
She fished him, she says from dat stream

It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
Dey tell all you chillun
De debble's a villun
But 'tain't necessarily so
To get into hebbben
Don't snap fo' a sebben -
Live clean! don' have no fault!
Oh, I takes dat gospel
Whenever it's pos'ple -
But wid a grain of salt!
Methus'lah lived nine hundred years
Methus'lah lived nine hundred years
But who calls dat livin'
When no gal'll give in
To no man what's nine hundred years?
I'm preachin' dis sermon to show
It ain't nessa, ain't nessa
It ain't necessarily so!
