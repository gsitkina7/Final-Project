There's a silver trail of moonlight
Leading upward to the sky
And the night is like a velvet lullaby
There's a Heaven of blue
And we'll go there just you and i

Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us
To fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us
As we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hills?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
Settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely, lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven
To climb to Heaven with you
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely, lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven
To climb to Heaven with you
