Maybe I should have saved
Those leftover dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day
They told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it may turn out this way
Where is that worn out wish
That I threw aside
After my lover was so near
Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
And funny, that rainy day is here
Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
And funny, that rainy day is here
That rainy day, that rainy day is here
