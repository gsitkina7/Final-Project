I'm on the beam, I've got a flash
On how to live in the civilization
To make a dream come out of hash
Give a little, get a little love
A morning smile, an evening kiss
Can be the pills for the ills of the nation
Don't cramp your style, remember this
Give a little, get a little love

No love, no hope
Then life's a dungeon, so throw the sponge in
With love there's hope
Sing hey hallelu'
So take a share and share the fun
And keep the cold from this old constellation
It's everywhere for everyone
Make a little, take a little
Take a little, live a little
Give a little, get a little love

You carry on, tied in a knot
To earn the pay that your neighbor is earning
But when it's gone, what have you got?
Give a little, get a little love
You never think 'till there's a storm
And 'til the real things you feel like returning
You know that mink won't keep you warm
Give a little, get a little love

No love, no joy
Then life's a nuisance and not worth two cents
With love, there's joy
Sing hey hallelu'

So take a share and share the fun
And keep the cold from this old constellation
It's everywhere for everyone
Make a little, take a little
Take a little, live a little
Give a little, get a little love
No joy, no joy
Give a little, get a little
Give a little, get a little
Make a little, take a little
Live a little, give a little
Give a little, get a little love
