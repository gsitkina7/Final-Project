Oh ay oh ay yay! Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh, yea ay yea ay!
They can't keep a gooda man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin for a search, they found no weapon just only a draw first
Cause I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set there traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now
When they come with there evilest thoughts i just listen whenever they talk
Jah is the light into my dark, he cut and tear my path
They fight without a cause tryin to make my life so hard
The king of kings and the lord of lords, give it all rewards
I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set there traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now
So don't you mix me up with your dirty games, your only tryin to tarnish my name
Your only lookin for the innocent to blame
When your the ones who issue the guns down the lane
You only cause dysfunction anda frame, but the right ones believe in the reignLove is all i got I give and I'm not ashamed, lookin towards the future this lion can't tame
So they can't keep a gooda man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin beter when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin for a search, they found no weapon just a only draw first
So solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set there traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now
