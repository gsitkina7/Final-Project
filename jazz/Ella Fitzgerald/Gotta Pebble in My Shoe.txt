Got a pebble in my shoe, buddy. ouch
Got a pebble in my shoe, buddy, ouch
Got a pebble in my shoe, buddy, ouch
I gotta keep dancing all the time
How'd it ever get in my little toesy?
Never thought a pebble could be as nosy
Gotta shake it out of my little hosey
Gotta keep dancing all the time

Now it's going to my heel
Maybe I got socks appeal
I know how a floogy feels
Hoy-da-doy-da-doy-doy
Got a pebble in my shoe, buddy, ouch
Got a pebble in my shoe, buddy, ouch
Only one thing I can do, oh
I gotta keep dancing all the time


I got a pebble in my shoe, buddy, ouch
I got a pebble in my shoe, buddy, ouch
I got a pebble in my shoe, buddy, ouch
And I gotta keep dancing all the time
Now, how'd it ever get in my little toesy?
Never thought a pebble could be so nosy
Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
And I gotta keep dancing all the time
