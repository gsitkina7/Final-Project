When the rhythm gets to rockin' on the swing side
And the cats condescend to lend an ear
When the beatniks start to gather 'round the ringside
There's a certain thing they always want to hear
Seven-twenty, seven-twenty in the books
What's the tune they like the best
When the jive becomes deluxe?
What's the number one request?
Seven-twenty in the books
When the band begins to play
You should see the dirty looks
If the leader doesn't say
Seven-twenty in the books
It's something that you'll approve
Gets you right in the groove
To keep in step
You really gotta be hep
Just be like the kangaroo
Or the fishes in the brooks
Ev'rybody's jumpin' to
Seven-twenty in the books
It's something that you'll approve
Gets you out of the groove
To keep in step
You really gotta be hep
Just be like the kangaroo
Or the fishes in the brooks
Ev'rybody's jumpin' to
Seven-twenty in the books
Seven-twenty
Seven-twenty
Seven-twenty
Let's keep jumpin' to seven-twenty in the books
