It's the wonder of the world, It's a rocket to the moon
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...
Here's to my best romance, Here's to my worst romance
Here's to my first romance - ages ago
Here's to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here's to the boys who said "No!"
Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let's fight for love
Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!
It's the rocket to the moon, with a touch of "Clare de Lune"
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...
Some trust to fate for love
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berzerk for love
Loafers even go to work for love
Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love
Just the same - hooray for love!
