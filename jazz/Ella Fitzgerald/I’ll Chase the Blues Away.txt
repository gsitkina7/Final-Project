I'll chase the blues away
I'll laugh and sing all day
I've found my lover, someone who'll be true
The blue birds in a tree
Will sing their song to me
For they'll discover I'm no longer blue
I've travelled far
In search of someone like you
For what you are
Is the dream that I've prayed would soon come true

I'll chase the blues away
I'll print some news today
I've found my lover, someone who'll be true
