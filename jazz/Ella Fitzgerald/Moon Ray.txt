Moonray
Cast your spell upon my lover
Under this starlit cover
Use all your magic charms
Oh, moonray
Let your sweet enchantment blind you
Then I shall wait to find you
Here in my lonely arms
Once we knew the joy
Of girl in love with boy
But he made a toy of romance
So, moonray
Put an end to all my sorrows
Bless me with sweet tomorrows
Bring back my love to me
Once we knew the joy
Of girl in love with boy
But he made a toy of romance
He made a toy of romance
So, moonray
Put an end to all my sorrows
Bless me with sweet tomorrows
Bring back my love to me
Oh, sunrays, moonrays
Bring back my love to me
