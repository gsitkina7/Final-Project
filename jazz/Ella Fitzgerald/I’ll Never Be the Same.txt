I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once used to be

And when the sun-birds that sing, tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside I'll never be the same
Never be the same again


And when the sun-birds that sing, tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong

I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside I'll never be the same
Never be the same again, again

My heart will never be the same again
Again
