The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
A murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide
That great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
She's all of these and more
She's everything that you'd adore
The song of a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
A murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide
That great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
She's all of these and more
She's everything that you'd adore
Have you seen Stella by starlight
With moon in her hair?
That's Stella by starlight
Raptures so rare
She's all of this and more
She's everything that you'd adore
