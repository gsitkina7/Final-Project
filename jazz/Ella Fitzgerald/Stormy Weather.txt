Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time
When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

I walk around
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pouring down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin'
Drivin' me mad
Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time
