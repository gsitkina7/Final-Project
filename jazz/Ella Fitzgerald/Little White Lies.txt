It was just a night like this
Filled with bliss, you led my heart astray
It was just a real sweet chance
To learn romance in a perfect way
It was the end of a perfect day, say the
Moon was all aglow and heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know
That you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me, those little white lies
I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears
The devil was in your heart
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies
