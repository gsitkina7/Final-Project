Baby, baby, I miss you so very much, it hurts me
Baby, I just gotta, I gotta have my baby back
Can't sleep, can't eat because I've lost my sweet baby sweet
I just gotta, I just gotta, I gotta have my baby back
Alone in a tavern people all around
Laughing and dancing, paintin' the town
Jukebox is playing songs about you
Songs with memories making me blue
Oh baby, come on home without my baby
I just can't go on
I just gotta, I just gotta
I gotta have my baby back
Alone in a tavern people all around
Laughing and dancing, paintin' the town
Jukebox is playing songs about you
Songs with memories making me blue
Oh baby, come on home without my baby
I just can't get along
I just gotta, I gotta
I gotta have my baby back
