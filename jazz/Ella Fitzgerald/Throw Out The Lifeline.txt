Throw out the life line across the dark wave;
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! O who then will dare
To throw out the life line, his peril to share?
Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is drifting away;
Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is sinking today
Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong:
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today
And out with the life boat! away, then away!
Throw out the life line to danger fraught men
Sinking in anguish where you've never been;
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow
Soon will the season of rescue be o'er
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore;
Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay
But throw out the life line and save them today
This is the life line, oh, tempest tossed men;
Baffled by waves of temptation and sin;
Wild winds of passion, your strength cannot brave
But Jesus is mighty, and Jesus can save
Jesus is able! To you who are driv'n
Farther and farther from God and from Heav'n;
Helpless and hopeless, o'erwhelmed by the wave;
We throw out the life line, 'tis 'Jesus can save.'
This is the life line, oh, grasp it today!
See, you are recklessly drifting away;
Voices in warning, shout over the wave
O grasp the strong life line, for Jesus can save
