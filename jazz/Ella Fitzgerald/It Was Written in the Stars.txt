It was written in the stars
What was written in the stars shall be
It was written in the skies
That the heart and not the eyes shall see
And so whether it bring joy
Whether it bring woe
It shall be done
Now suddenly i know
You are the one
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
It was written high above
That i have to have your love
Or i'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though i may be
What the stars foretold shall be
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
It was written high above
That i have to have your love
Or i'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though i may be
What the stars foretold shall be
And so shall it be...
