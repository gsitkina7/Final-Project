Blow ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)
Go ill wind, go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood, and that's no good
You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame
So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)
Musical interlude
You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame
So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)
Blow, ill wind, blow
