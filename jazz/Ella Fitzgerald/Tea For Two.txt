Picture me upon your knee
Just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me alone
Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear
Day will break and I'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you and a girl for me
Oh, can't you see how happy we would be?
