Baby, take me down to Duke’s Place
Wildest box in town is Duke’s Place
Love that piano sound in Duke’s Place
Saxes do their tricks in Duke’s Place
Fellas swing their chicks in Duke’s Place
Come on! Get your kicks in Duke’s Place
You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
You look around and yell, waiter
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
You’re jetting along with your girlie
It’s after three o’clock, but baby, it’s still early
If you’ve never been to Duke’s Place
Take your tootsies into Duke’s Place
Life is in a spin in Duke’s Place
