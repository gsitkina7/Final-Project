When he was a young man courting the girls
He played a waiting game
If a maid refused him with tossing curls
He'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
For as time went along, she came his way
As time went along, she came

But it's a long, long while from May to December
And the days grow short when you reach September
The autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And I haven't got time for the waiting game
Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you
