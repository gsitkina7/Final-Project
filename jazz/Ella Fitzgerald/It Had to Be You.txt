It had to be you
It had to be you
I've wandered around
Finally found
Somebody who
Could make me be true
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinkin' of you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
'Cause nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all yo' faults
I love you still now
And it had to be you
It just had to be you
It had to be you
