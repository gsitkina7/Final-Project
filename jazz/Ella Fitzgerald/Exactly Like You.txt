Oh, incidentally, ladies and gentlemen
We're not doing any requests
We're just doing what comes naturally

I know why I've waited
I know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you
Why should we spend money
On a show or two?
For no one does those love scenes
Exactly like you
You make me feel so grand
I wanna give the world to you
You seem to understand
Each foolish little dream I'm dreaming
Scheme I'm scheming

I know why my mother
Taught me to be true
'Cause she meant me for someone
Exactly like you


Lou Levy, ladies and gentlemen, at the piano


Play it, Lou


Thank you, thank you, Lou Levy
How about a hand for Lou Levy?
He played for you

I know why I've waited
I know why I've been blue
I've been waiting for an audience
Crazy like you
Why should we spend money
On a show or two?
I could sing all night, I could sing all night
For people like you

You make me feel so grand
Could stand up here and wail all night for you
But you must understand
That sometimes you
It won't come out, the voice won't come out
And so you see, and so you see, and so you see
Exactly for you

I know why I've waited
I know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give the world to you
Seem to understand
Each foolish little dream I'm dreaming

I know why my mother
Taught me to be true
'Cause she meant me for someone
Exactly like you
Exactly like you
Exactly like you
Exactly like you

Well, I'm left with the drummer
And here we go, here we go, on with the show
And everybody knows that I'm trying to say
That I love you, I love you, I love you madly
And I've been waiting, hoping and badly
For an audience exactly like you
Thank you
