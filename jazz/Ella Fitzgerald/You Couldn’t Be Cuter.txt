You couldn't be cuter
Plus that
You couldn't be smarter
Plus that
Intelligent face
You have a disgrace-
Ful charm
For me
You couldn't be keener
You look so fresh from the cleaner
You are the little grand slam
I'll take to my fam-
Ily
My ma will show you an album of me that'll bore you to tears
And you'll attract all the relatives we have dodged for years and years
And what will they tell me?
Exactly, what will they tell me
Let's say you couldn't be nicer
Couldn't be sweeter
Couldn't be better
Couldn't be smoother
Couldn't be cuter, baby, than you are
My ma will show you an album of me that'll bore you to tears
And you'll attract all the relatives we have dodged for years and years
And what will they tell me?
I know just what they will tell me
They'll say you couldn't be nicer
Couldn't be sweeter
Couldn't be better
Couldn't be smoother
Couldn't be cuter, baby, than you are
