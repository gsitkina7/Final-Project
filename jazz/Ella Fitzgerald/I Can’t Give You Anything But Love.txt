Gee but it's tough to be broke kid
It's not a joke kid
It's a curse
My luck is changing it's gotten from simply roten
To something worst
Who knows someday i will win too
I'll begin to reach my pride
Now that i see what our end is
All can spend is just my time
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while. Scheme a while
We're sure to find
Happiness, and I guess
All those things you've always pined for
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell
My little baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth's doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
