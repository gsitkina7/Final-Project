All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there, playing solitaire
All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older all by myself
All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there, playing solitaire
All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older all by myself, all by myself
