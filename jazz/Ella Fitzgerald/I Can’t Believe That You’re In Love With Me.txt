Your eyes are blue
Your kisses too
I never knew
What they could do
I can't believe that you're in love with me
You are telling
Everyone I know
I'm on your mind
Each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me
I have always placed you
Far far above me
I just can't imagine that you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that I'm the lucky one
I can't believe that you're in love with me
Your eyes are blue
Your kisses too
I can't believe that you're in love with me
You are telling
Everyone I know
I'm on your mind
Each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me
I have always placed you
Far far above me
I just can't imagine that you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that I'm the lucky one
I can't believe that you're in love with me
