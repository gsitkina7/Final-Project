I don't want you
But I hate to lose you
You've got me in between
The Devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you
'Cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between
The Devil and the deep blue sea
I oughta cross you off my list
But when you come knockin' at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you
But I guess I love you
You've got me in between
The Devil and the deep blue sea
I oughta cross you off my list
But when you come knockin' at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you
But I guess I love you
(scat interlude)
You've got me in between
The Devil and the deep blue sea
