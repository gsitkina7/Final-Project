Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll buy you almost anything
If it makes you feel alright
For I don't care too much for money
'Coz money can't buy me love
I'll give you everything I've got
If you'd say you love me too
I may not have an awful lot
But what I've got I'd give to you
For I don't care too much for money
'Coz money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy
For I don't care too much for money
'Coz money can't buy me love
Who wants money? Yeah
I don't need no money
For I don't care too much for money
'Coz money can't buy me love
Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy
For I don't care too much for money
'Coz money can't buy me love
Money can't buy me love
Money can't buy me love
No, no, money can't buy me love
