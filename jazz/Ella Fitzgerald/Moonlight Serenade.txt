I stand at your gate
And the song that I sing is of moonlight
I stand and I wait
For the touch of your hand in the June night
The roses are sighing
A moonlight serenade
The stars are aglow
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming
My love, do you know
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you, and sing you
A moonlight serenade
Let us stray, till break of day
In love's valley of dreams
Just you and I, a summer sky
A heavenly breeze kissing the trees
So don't let me wait
Come to me tenderly in the June night
I stand at your gate
And I sing you a song in the moonlight
A love song, my darling
A moonlight serenade
