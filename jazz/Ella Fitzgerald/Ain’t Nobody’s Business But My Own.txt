Everybody's got a business
And I've got one too
You can't mind your business
What's the matter with you?
You've got a gal you love her Sunday
Then you get another for Monday
Ain't nobody's business but my own
You say you're always home alone
Now, how come I can't get you on the phone?
That ain't nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
All night long you're playin' poker
Tell me, what's the name of that joker?
Ain't nobody's business but my own
I come over and say, "Here I am"
Then I hear the back door slam
That ain't nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own

You tell me you're in bed by seven
But your light's on way past eleven
Well it ain't nobody's business but my own
Now, you ain't so smart and you ain't good lookin'
Tell me, how come you got so much cookin'?
Ain't nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Let's not fuss and let's not fight
I'm sick and tired of sayin' "Goodnight"
Well, let's make up and hold each other tight
We both know we're birds of a feather
Let's go into business together
We can start a business of our own
We fuss and we fight
We made up tonight
And it's nobody's business (Tell 'em, honey)
It's nobody's business (Straighten 'em out)
It's nobody's business but our own
