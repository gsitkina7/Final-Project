That old black magic's got me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers
Up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle that I feel inside
And when that elevator starts its ride
Darling down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
You're the lover
You're the lover
You're the lover
You're the lover
I have waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And everytime your lips meet mine
Darling down and down I go
Round and Round I go
In a spin, I'm loving the spin that I'm in
I'm Under that old black magic called love
Yes I'm in a spin, I'm loving the spin I'm in
I'm under that old black magic called love
Got me spinning and spinning and spinning around
Like an elevator's going down
In this magic, black magic called love
