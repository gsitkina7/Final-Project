I really can't stay
(But baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away
(But baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been
(Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful what's your hurry)
And Father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry
(Beautiful please don't hurry)
Well maybe just a half a drink more
(Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbours might think
(But baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink?
(No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how
(Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break the spell
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say no no no sir
(Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
(What's the sense of hurting my pride?)
I really can't stay
(Oh baby don't hold out)
AH BUT ITS COLD OUTSIDE!
I simply must go'
(But baby it's cold outside)
The answer is no'
(But baby it's cold outside)
The welcome has been
(How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm
(Look out that window at that storm!)
My sister will be suspicious
(God your lips look delicious!)
My brother will be there at the door
(Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
(God your lips are delicious )
Well maybe just a cigarette more
(Never such a blizzard before)
I got to get home
(But baby you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a comb
(It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand
(I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see?
(How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think of my life-long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that old out)
AH BUT ITS COLD OUTSIDE!
(Where you could be going when the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?)
BABY ITS COLD, COLD OUTSIDE!
