She didn't say yes
She didn't say no
She didn't say stay
She didn't say go
She only knew that he had spied her there
And then she knew he sat beside her there
At first there was heard not one little word
Then coyly she took one sly little look
And something awoke and smiled inside
Her heart began beating wild inside
So what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too
She didn't say yes
She didn't say no
They very soon stood beside his chateau
They lingered like two poor waifs outside
For well she knew 'twas only safe outside
In there it was warm, out there it was cold
The sleet and the storm said, "Better be bold"
She murmured, "I'm not afraid of ice
I only wish that I was made of ice"
So what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too
She didn't say yes
She didn't say no
She wanted to stay
But knew she should go
She wasn't so sure that he'd be good
She wasn't even sure that she'd be good
She wanted to rest
All cuddled and pressed
A palpable part of somebody's heart
She'd love to be on rapport with him
But not behind a bolted door with him
And what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too
She didn't say yes
She didn't say no
For heaven was near
She wanted it so
Above her sweet love was beckoning
And yet she knew there'd be a reckoning
She wanted to climb
But dreaded to fall
So bided her time
And clung to the wall
She wanted to act ad libitum
But feared to lose her equilibrium
So what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too
