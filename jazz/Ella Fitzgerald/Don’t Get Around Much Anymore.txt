Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why bring back old memories?

Been invited to dance
Might have gone, but what for?
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore


Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Been invited to clubs
Would have gone, but what for?
I'll feel awkward some without you
Don't get around much anymore

Yes, darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why bring back old memories?
Been invited to dance
Might have gone, but what for?
I'll be lonesome without you
Don't get around much anymore
