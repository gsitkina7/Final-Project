It's getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you, my darling
Give you my dawn surprise
I'll be with you soon, my darling
I'll be with you when the stars start falling
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
Can't you hear me calling?

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
I'm with you, my love
It's the morning and just we two
Yes, I'm with you, my love
Can't you see the morning sun shining down on you?
I'm with you, my love
Woo, ooh, and it's me and you
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on sunshine
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on sunshine

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

Oh, come on, baby
You hear me screaming for baby
I said I'm waiting for you, daddy
I'm waiting in the sunshine

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
Yes, I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
Woo-ooh, in your love
In the sunshine of your love
Of your love
Of your
Love
