You leave me breathless
You heavenly thing
You look so wonderful
You're like a breath of spring
You leave me speechless
I'm just like the birds
I'm filled with melody
But at a loss for words
That little grin of yours
That funny chin of yours
There's so much to my heart
Or give your lips to me
For darling that would be
The final touch to my heart
You leave me breathless
That's all I can say
I can't say more because
You take my breath away
That little grin of yours
That funny chin of yours
There's so much to my heart
Or give your lips to me
For darling that would be
The final touch to my heart
You leave me breathless
That's all, that's all I can say
I can't say more because
You take my breath away
