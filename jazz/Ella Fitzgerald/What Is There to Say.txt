Darling, pardon my confusion
But are you an optical illusion?
And if not, then what on Earth
Are you doing to me?
If my speech is willy-nilly
It's because I cannot guild the lily
I should laugh to sing your praises
But phrases and words are silly
What is there to say?
And what is there to do?
The dream I've been seeking has
Practically speaking, come true
What is there to say?
And how will I pull through?
I knew in a moment contentment
And home meant just you
You are so lovable, so livable
You're beauty is just unforgivable
You're made to marvel at
And words to that affair
So what is there say?
And what is there to do?
My heart's in a deadlock
I'd even face wedlock with you
I knew in a moment contentment
And home meant just you
So what is there to say?
And what is there to do?
My heart's in a deadlock
I'd even face wedlock with you
