If you've never had to count a million sheep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue
If you've never had to cry yourself to sleep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue
I know I could go on laughing and troubled
Plain trouble
But when it concerns the heart
The pain seems doubled
Never worry about a little hurt or two
There's nothing at all bothering you
If you've never had a pal who stole your gal
Then you've never known you've never been blue
Something that this life will mind is plain, honey
That's funny
When you're miles away from home
It's not so sunny
No one ever knows what I go through
While someone at home is babying you
If you've never had to miss a goodnight kiss
Then you've never known you've never been blue
