If you ever change your mind
I'll be around where I used to be
Lonely heart and all, waiting for your call
If you ever change your mind
Since you've been away, I find
Nobody else means a thing to me
And I miss you so, but you'll only know
If you ever change your mind

A million times I've wondered
How we could've said goodbye
A million times I've wondered
If you feel the same as I
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Though you left my love behind
I'd wait an endless eternity
Makes no difference who once appealed to you
I'll be gentle, sweet, and kind, dear
If you ever change your mind
