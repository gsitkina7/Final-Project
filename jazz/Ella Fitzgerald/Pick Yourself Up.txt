Nothing's impossible, I have found
For when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up, dust myself off
And start all over again
Don't lose your confidence if you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up, dust yourself off
Start all over again
Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So, take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off
Start all over again
Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off
And start right over again
