The gentleman is a dope, a man of many faults
A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rumba from a Waltz
The gentleman is a dope and not my cup of tea
Why do I get in a dither? He doesn't belong to me
The gentleman isn't bright, he doesn't know the score
A cake will come, he'll take a crumb and never ask for more
The gentleman's eyes are blue but little do they see
Why am I beating my brains out? He doesn't belong to me
He's somebody else's problem, she's welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well as I
The gentleman is a dope, he isn't very smart
He's just a lug you'd like to hug and hold against you heart
The gentleman is a dope doesn't know how happy he could
Look at me crying my eyes out, as if he belonged to me
He'll never belong to me
He's somebody else's problem, she's welcome, welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well, well as I
The gentleman is a dope, he isn't very smart
He's just a lug you'd like to hug and hold against you heart
The gentleman is a dope doesn't know how happy he could
Look at me crying my eyes out, as if he belonged to me
He'll never belong to me
