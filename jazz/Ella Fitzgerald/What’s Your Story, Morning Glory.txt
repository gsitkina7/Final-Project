What's your story, morning glory?
What makes you look so blue?
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one makes two
What's your story, morning glory?
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So won't you let me that you love me, too

What is your story, morning glory?
You've got me worried, too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it? Then you know that I love you
What's your story, morning glory?
If I guess it, darling, will you confess it?
Oh, won't you tell me that you love me, too

Oh, won't you tell me that you love me, too
What's your story, morning glory?
