It was back in 1922
You let other women make a fool of you
But it's now 1953
You're doing the same thing, don't do it to me
You had plenty money back in 22
You let other women make a fool of you
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Just get out of here and get me some money too
You're sittin' down wonderin' what it's all about
If you don't get no money they will throw you out
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Just get out of here and get me some money too
It was back in 1944
You kept on running from door to door
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Just get out of here and get me some money too
I fell for your jiving and I took you in
All you had to offer was a drink of gin
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Just get out of here and get me some money too
You ain't got no money, ain't got, no use for you
You ain't got no money, ain't got, no use for you
So get out of here and get me some money too
I've got man in the east, a man in the west
But I found out that gold is the best
Got no money, ain't got, no use for you
So get out of here and get me some money too
Why don't you do right? Why don't you do right?
Why don't you do right? Come on and do right
Like some other, like some other men do
