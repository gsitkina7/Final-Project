This is the end of a beautiful friendship
It ended a moment ago
This is the end of a beautiful friendship
I know for your eyes told me so
We were always been
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other
That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love
We were always been
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other
That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love
