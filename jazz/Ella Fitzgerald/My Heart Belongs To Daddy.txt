I used to fall in love with all
Those boys who call on young cuties
But now I find I'm all inclined
To keep my mind on my duties
Since I've begun to share
In such a sweet love affair
Though I'm in love, I'm not above
A date with a duke or a caddie
It's just a pose, 'cause my baby knows
That my heart belongs to daddy
When some good scout invites me out
To dine om some fine finnan haddie
My baby's sure his love is secure
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, I'm gonna marry daddy
Dad
If you feel romantic, laddy
Let me warn you right from the start
That my heart belongs to daddy
And my daddy belongs to my heart
