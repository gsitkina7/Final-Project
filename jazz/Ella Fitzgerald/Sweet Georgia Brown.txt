No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet, but oh so neat, has sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and wanna die for sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie, not much
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came why it's a shame how she cools 'em down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet Georgia Brown
No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet, but oh so neat, has sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and wanna die for sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie, not much
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came why it's a shame how she cools 'em down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met

Sweet Georgia Brown
No gal, not a gal got a shade like Georgia Brown
Two feet, such sweet, sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and wanna die for the gal called Georgia Brown
Listen till I tell ya, lemme tell ya why, you know that I don't lie
All those tips the courters slip to sweet Georgia Brown
They buy clothes at fashion shows with one dollar down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met
But oh boy, tip your hats, oh joy, she's the cat, she's-
No gal has got a shade on sweet
She's got two left feet, but oh so neat
She's got money and clothes and diamonds too
There's just nothing that gal can't do
She's got the guys all hangin' around
How she really cools 'em down
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet Georgia Brown
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Just sweet old Georgia Brown
