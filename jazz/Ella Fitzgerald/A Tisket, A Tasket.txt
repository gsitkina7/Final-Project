Thank you

A-tisket, a-tasket
A brown and yellow basket
I send a letter to my mommy
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And put it in her pocket
She was truckin' on down the avenue
With not a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, pecking all around
When she spied it on the ground
She took it, she took it
My little yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I will die

A-tisket, a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
And if that girlie don't return it
Don't know what I'll do

Oh gee, I wonder where my basket can be
Have you seen it over there?
Oh dear, I wish that little girl I could see
Have you seen her over there?
Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine?
That itty bitty basket was a joy of mine

A-tisket, a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
Won't someone help me find my basket
Make me happy again?
(Was it green?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it red?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it blue?)
No, no, no, no, just a little yellow basket
A little yellow basket
