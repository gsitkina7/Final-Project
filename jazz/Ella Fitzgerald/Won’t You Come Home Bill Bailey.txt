Thank you, you're very kind
Won't you come home Bill Bailey?
Won't you come home?
Ah you've been away...too long
I do that cooking honey
You just bring home the money
Bill Bailey, please come on home
Each night, when we sing this
We're making an attempt to swing this
We sing this song a different way
That's why I say
Who knows, like Mack the Knife
You may play this song all your life
So Bill Bailey, won't you come on home?
As Miss Sophie Tucker might say:
Won't you come home Bill Bailey?
I say won't you come home?
Oh, you've been away
Oh honey you've been away too long
I'll do that cooking honey, yes-ah
You just bring home the money
Some of these days, Bill
You're gonna come on home
As Miss Della Reese might say:
Won't you come home Bill Bailey?
I say won't you come home?
I say you've been away... too long
And as Miss Pearl Bailey might say:
Bill, honey, daddy you'd better bring it on home
Cause honey I'm just so tired of waiting on you
Honey these shoes, I, I'm telling your baby it can't wait no longer
Yes I said
Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come on home, Bill Bailey?
I say you've been away too long
Since you've been gone there's no stopping
To this thing they call bee-bopping
So Bailey, please come on home
Now everybody twist it
I say everybody twist it
So Bailey please come home, no more to roam
I've sung the lyrics to this song so long
I guess it's time to say so long
So Bailey, won't you come on home?
Mama needs loving!
Bill, Bailey, won't you come
Come home...
