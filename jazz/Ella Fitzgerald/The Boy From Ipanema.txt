For the Bossa Nova fans, we'd like to throw in one

Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes
Each girl he passes goes, ah
When he walks
He's like a samba
That swings so cool, sways so gentle
That when he passes
Each girl he passes goes, ah
Oh, how I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him?
Oh, but I love him so madly
When he goes for a stroll by the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes, I smile
But he doesn't see

Oh, how I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him?
Oh, but I love him so madly
When he goes for a stroll by the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes, I smile
But he doesn't see
No, he doesn't see
No, no, no, no, he doesn't see
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
The boy, boy, boy from Ipanema
The boy from Ipanema
The boy from Ipanema
Ipanema, Ipanema, Ipanema, Ipanema
Say the boy from Ipanema
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The boy from Ipanema
