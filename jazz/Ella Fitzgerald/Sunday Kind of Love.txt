I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last, past Saturday night
I'd like to know, it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love
I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody to care
I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love
I do all my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way
My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Monday's are cold
A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love
I do my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way
My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Monday's are cold
A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love
I asked the Lord above please send me someone to love
A special Sunday kind of love
