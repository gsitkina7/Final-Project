Georgia
Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
Through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The roads leads back to you
Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind


Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
