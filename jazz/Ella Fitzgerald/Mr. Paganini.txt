The concert was over in Carnagie Hall
The maestro took bow after bow
He said, "My dear friends I have given my all
I'm sorry, it's all over now."
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry
Oh, Mr. Paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat
Listen Paganini
We breathlessly await your masterful dtente
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to
Scat
We heard your repertoire
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
Ã‚'I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'
Would do
So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Scat
Listen Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, won't you sing it?
If the boys is bopping
Ain't no need in stopping
Scat
Listen Paganini
We breathlessly await your masterful dtente
Come on and spring it
If the boys is bopping
Ain't no need in stopping
Scat
I heard your repertoire and
At the final bar
We greeted you, we greeted you
With wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of
Scat
Listen Paganini
Now, don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Swing it
