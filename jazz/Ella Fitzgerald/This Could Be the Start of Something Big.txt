You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big
You're lunching at Twenty-One and watchin' your diet
Declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy
And this could be the start of something big
There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in the magic book
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend
Invite her in without a second look
You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand
This could be the start of something very big
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me....and see
This could be the start of something wonderful
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me....and see
Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is
And this must be the start of something...
This could be the heart of something...
This could be the start of something big
