Ooh, I get the blues every night
Since I fell for you
I'm so blue
You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I know I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
Well, it's too bad, and it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
Oh, you love me, then you snub me
Oh, what can I do?
I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you


Well, it's too bad, and it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
Oh, you love me, then you snub me
Oh, what can I do?
I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Well, I'm so lonesome, lonesome I could cry
Oh, you left me and I feel like I wanna die
I'm blue
Since I fell for you
Guess I'll never leave my happy home
