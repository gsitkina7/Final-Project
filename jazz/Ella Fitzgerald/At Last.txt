At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known

You smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

At last, mmm
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you


You smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
At last, you are mine
At last
