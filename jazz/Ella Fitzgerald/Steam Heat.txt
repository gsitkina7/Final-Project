I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I can't get warm without your hand to hold

The radiator's hissin', still I need your kissin'
To keep me from freezing each night
I've got a hot water bottle, but nothing I've got'll
Take the place of you holding me tight
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold

They told me to shove some more coal in the boiler
They told me to shove some more coal in the boiler
They told me to shove some more coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
But that don't do no good


I gotta shovel more coal in the boiler
I gotta shovel more coal in the boiler
I gotta shovel more coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
Shovel, keep shovelin'
Shovel more coal in the boiler
More coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
The radiator's hissin', still I need your kissin'
To keep me from freezing each night
Got a hot water bottle, but nothing I've got'll
Take the place of you holding me tight
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold
Man, I need love real bad
Yes, I need your love real bad
