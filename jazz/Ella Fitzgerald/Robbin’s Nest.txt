Give me something gentle
Make it sentimental
Whatever you could suggest
I'll take Robbin's Nest
Make it sweet and tender
So I must surrender
You know I'd like nothing but the best
So I'll take Robbin's Nest
For when I get that feeling
Goin' 'round and 'round
Something brings me down
Way down, way down

Give me something sweet and gentle
Make it sentimental
For whatever you could suggest
I'll take Robbin's Nest


When I get that feeling
Goin' 'round and 'round
Something brings me down
Oh, way down, way down

Give me something sweet and gentle
Make it sentimental
For whatever you could suggest
I'll take Robbin's Nest
