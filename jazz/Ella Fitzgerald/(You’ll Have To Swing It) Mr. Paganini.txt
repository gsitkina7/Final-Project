The concert was over in Carnagie Hall
The maestro took bow after bow
He said, "My dear friends I have given my all
I'm sorry, it's all over now."
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Oh, Mr. Paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it
Won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing
You simply have to
Scat

Listen, Paganini
We breathlessly await
Your masterful d'tente
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it
You simply have to
Scat
We heard your repertoire
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
"I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies"
Would do

So, Paganini, don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it
You simply have to
Scat

Listen, Paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it
Won't you sing it?
If the boys is bopping
Ain't no need in stopping
Scat
Listen Paganini
We breathlessly await
Your masterful d'tente
Come on and spring it
If the boys is bopping
Ain't no need in stopping
Scat

I heard your repertoire and
At the final bar
We greeted you, we greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of
Scat

Listen, Paganini
Now, don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it
You simply have to swing it
