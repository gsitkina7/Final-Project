Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair
Tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair
Right from the start you took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true
So I'll make a vow
No more to love's shrine will I bow
I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
This is my last affair
Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair
I say, tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair
Right from the start you took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true
So I'll make a vow
No more to love's shrine will I bow
I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
This is my last affair
This is my last affair
