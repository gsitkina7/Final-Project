Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Come you sinners, gather 'round
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
All you sinners I have found
A land where the weary forever are free
Come you sinners and just follow me
Forget your troubles and just get happy
Ya better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, c'mon get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
The sun is shinin' c'mon get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah c'mon get happy
We're goin' to the Promised Land
We're headin' 'cross the river
Wash our sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side
Forget your troubles and just get happy
Ya better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, c'mon get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
We're headin' 'cross the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side
Forget your troubles and just get happy
Ya better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah c'mon get happy
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Get ready for the Judgment Day
