Two little men in a flying saucer
Flew down to Earth one day
Looked to left and right of it
Couldn’t stand the sight of it
And said "Let’s fly away
They took a look at a Western movie
Somebody heard them say
"If a horse can be a star
Think how dumb the people are
We'd better fly away"
Then they shook their little green antennas
Scratched their purple hair
Said, "This planet is an awful menace
Let's go back to where we came from"

Two little men in a flying saucer
Just didn't care to stay (No, no)
Said, "It's too peculiar here"
Headed for the stratosphere
And quickly flew away

Now they took a left in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn
When the Dodgers played a baseball game
Heard all the screaming
Said, "We must be dreaming 'cause this planet is insane"
During intermission, heard a politician
Making speeches as they traveled by
(Gabble, gabble, gabble)
But they departed faster than they started
'Cause the holler blew them sky high

Two little men in a flying saucer
Flew down to Earth one day
Listened to a radio, saw a television show
And said, "Let's fly away"
They got their fill of commercial jingles
And they were heard to say
"All the people seem to be living in a nursery
We'd better fly away"
Traveled all around and once they’d seen us
Said, "Let's head for space
We were better off on Mars and Venus
Goodness, what a place to live in"

Two little men in a flying saucer
Just didn't care to stay (No, no)
Crossed a crowded thoroughfare
Saw the hats the women wear
And quickly flew away (Woo, woo)
And quickly flew away (Woo)
One look and then they flew away

Two little men in a flying saucer
Two little men in a flying saucer
Two little men in a flying saucer
Two little men in a flying saucer
