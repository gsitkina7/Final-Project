Oh baby, won't you please come home
'Cause your mama's all alone
I have tried in vain, never no more to call your name
When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Ev'ry hour in the day... you will hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home
{Sax solo}
When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Ev'ry hour in the day... you will hear me say
Oh baby, my baby
Baby won't you please come home
'Cause your mama needs some lovin'
Baby won't you please come on home
