Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney, bohohoho, bohohoho
Pour me
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
When he came last year
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
He won't come back I fear
There he was in the middle of the chimney
Roly-poly, fat, and round
There he was in the middle of the chimney
Not quite up and not quite down
Santa, please, come back to my chimney
Back to my chimney, back to my chimney
Santa, please, come back to my chimney
You can come back here
Cause daddy made a brand new chimney
Just for you this year
(Ohh, Ella is a little girl who's trying to be good)
Yet I find that things don't always turn out as they should
(Why, just last Christmas Eve she waited up for seven to drop five)
But I nearly missed him and here's the reason why
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
When he came last year
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
He won't come back I fear
There he was in the middle of the chimney
Roly-poly, fat, and round
There he was in the middle of the chimney
Not quite up and not quite down
Santa, please, come back to my chimney
Back to my chimney, back to my chimney
Santa, please, come back to my chimney
You can come back here
Cause daddy made a brand new chimney
Just for you this year
(Santa Clause come on down the chimney, please come back this year)
