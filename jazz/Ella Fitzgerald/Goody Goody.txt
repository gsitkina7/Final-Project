So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, goody goody!
Well you gave her your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
And she broke it in little pieces, now how do you do?

And you found that loves a barrell of dynamite!
Hurray and halleluyah, you had it comin to ya
Goody goody for you! goody goody for me! ya i hope you're
Satisfied you rascal you!
Do you remember me sittin' all alone waitin' for the tinkle of the telephone?

Yes you remember me, I was all for you, sittin' waitin' hoping like you told me
Too. Now the action jackson's turned right around
So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
