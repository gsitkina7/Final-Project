My fur coat's sold
Oh, Lord ain't it cold
But I'm not gonna holler
'cause I've still got a dollar
And when I get low
Ooh, I get high
My man walked out
Now you know that ain't right
Well he better watch out
If I meet him tonight
I said when I get low
Ooh, I get high
All the hard luck in this town has found me
Nobody knows how trouble goes 'round and 'round me
Ooh, I'm all alone
With no one to pet me
My old rocking chair
Ain't never gonna get me
â€˜cause when I get low
Ooh, I get high
When I get low
Ooh, I get high
