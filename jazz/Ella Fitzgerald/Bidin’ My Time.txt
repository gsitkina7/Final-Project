But I'm Bidin' My Time;
'Cause that's the kinda guy I'm
While other folks grow dizzy
I keep busy
Bidin' My Time
Next year, next year
Somethin's bound to happen;
This year, this year
I'll just keep on nappin'
And Bidin' My Time
'Cause that's the kinda guy I'm
There's no regrettin'
When I'm settin'
Bidin' My Time
