You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
