I Didnâ€™t Know About You Lyrics
I ran around with my own little crowd
The usual laughs, not often, but loud
And in the world that I knew
I didn't know about you
Chasing after the ring, on the merry-go-round
Just taking my fun where it could be found
And yet what else could I do
I didn't know about you
Darling, now I know
I had the loneliest yesterday, every day
In your arms
I know for once in my life, I'm living

Had a good time every time I went out
Romance was a thing I kidded about
How could I know about love
I didn't know about you

Darling, now I know
I had the loneliest yesterday, every day
In your arms
I know for once in my life, I'm living

Had a good time, every time I went out
Romance was a thing I kidded about
How could I know about love
I didn't know about you

I didn't know about you
