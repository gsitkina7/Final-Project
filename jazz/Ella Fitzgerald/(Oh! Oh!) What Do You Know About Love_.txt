You say you love me
You swear that you do
But how can you love me
And be so untrue?
Oh, oh, what do you know about love?
You say you mean it
How happy we'll be
But how can you mean it
And be mean to me?
Oh, oh, what do you know about love?
It's funny
When you hold me tight
It thrills me so much it's a sin
But, honey
When you hold me tight
This isn't love; it's the mood that you're in
I'd like to believe you
That we'll never part
How can I believe you
When you break my heart?
Oh, oh, what do you know about love?
It's funny
When you hold me tight
It thrills me so much it's a sin
But, honey
When you hold me tight
This isn't love; it's the mood that you're in
I'd like to believe you
That we'll never part
How can I believe you
When you break my heart?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you know about love?
Darlin', you say we'll never part
You'll mend a broken heart
I'd like to believe you
That we'll never part
How can I believe you
When you break my heart?
But what do you know about love?
