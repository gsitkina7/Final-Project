Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams
Gold, silver and all
All you can hold
Is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
As long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
Love, love, love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams
Gold, silver and all
All you can hold
Is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams
Gold, silver and all
All you can hold
Is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
