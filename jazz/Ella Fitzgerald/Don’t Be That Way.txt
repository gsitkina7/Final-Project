April skies are in your eyes
But darling, don't be blue
Don't cry
Oh honey please
Don't be that way
Clouds in the sky
Should never make you feel that way
The rain
Will bring the violets of May
Tears are in vain So honey please don't be that way
As long as we
See it through
You'll have me
I'll have you
Sweetheart
Tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart
Oh honey, please don't be that way
Don't cry
Oh honey please
Don't be that way
Clouds in the sky
Should never make you feel that way
The rain
Will bring the violets of May
Tears in vain
So honey please don't be that way
As long as we
Will see it through
You'll have me
And I'll have you
Sweetheart
Tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart
Oh honey, please don't be that way
Don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry
Oh honey, please don't be that way
Oh honey, please don't be that way
Clouds in the sky
Dig those crazy sky
Should never make you feel that way
So don't be that way
Dig the rain
Pitter pitter pitter pitter patter
Bring the violets of May
Pitter patter of the rain drops
Tears in vain
Tears, tears
So honey please don't be that way
Don't be that way
As long as we
(scat)
Will see it through
(scat)
Oh baby, you'll have me
(scat)
And I'll have you
(scat)
Sweetheart

Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day
