You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more?
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store
You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own
But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me
You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more?
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store
You used to call me the top
Ahh, you put me up on a throne
You let me fall oh with a drop
And now I'm out on my own
But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
Just like the sting of a bee
Just like the sting of a bee
Turned the tables on me
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz
You turned the tables on me
