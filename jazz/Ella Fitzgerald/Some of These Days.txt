Some of these days
You're gonna miss me, honey
Some of these days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
Gonna miss my kissin'
Gonna miss me, honey
When I'm away
You'll feel so lonely
Just want me only
But you know, honey
You had your way
And when you leave me
You know it'll grieve me
Gonna miss your little mama, mama, mama
Some of these days


Some of these days
You're gonna miss me, honey
Some of these days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
Gonna miss my kissin'
Gonna miss me, honey
When I'm away
I feel so lonely
For you only
But you know, honey
You had your way
And when you leave me
Gonna grieve me

You're gonna miss your baby some of these days
You're gonna miss me in a thousand ways
Hey daddy, remember what I say
Some of these days
I say when you leave me
Gonna grieve me
Remember when you're all alone on the shelf
Ain't got nobody but yourself
Can't drink those Bloody Marys by yourself
Ah, ah, I say, tell me you leave me
I know, I know it's gonna grieve me
Baby, some of these days
