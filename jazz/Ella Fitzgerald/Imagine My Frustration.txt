I went down to the dance
Such down by the wall
Invited to dance
By no one at all
The couples danced by
So charming and gay
But nobody once
Looked over my way

So awfully sad
Dissatisfied
It hurt so bad
I almost cried
Imagine my frustration
With no invitation to dance

Head high, standing tall
Who else, who else could I be?
But belle of the wall of the ball
Who likes what they see?
And then in my ear
Someone said to me
"Wallflower, my dear
How come you can't see?"

They couldn't care less
They're not impressed
As you might guess
You're in excess

Imagine my frustration
With no invitation to dance

I smiled to the crowd
Tip toe and alert
Yes, the band blew it loud
But nixed on a flirt
A voice said to me
"Wallflower, my dear
You're sweet as can be
But how come you're here?"

They couldn't care less
About your dress
You're in a mess
And in excess

Imagine my frustration
With no invitation to dance
