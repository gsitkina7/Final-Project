Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, baby
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, baby
First you pop, then you stop
The gum gets big and round
Blow your troubles
'Way like bubbles
When you hear that
Funny little sound
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, chew
Your bubble gum
Chew, chew, chew, chew your bubble gum
Listen, sis, you're havin' fun
Chewing on your bubble gum
Give us some and we shall see
Just what fills your heart with glee
Boys, you're right: I'm havin' fun
Chewin' on my bubble gum
Bubble gum it makes me sing
Here, chew some to make you swing
First you pop, then you stop
The gum gets big and round
Blow your troubles
'Way like bubbles
When you hear that
Funny little sound
