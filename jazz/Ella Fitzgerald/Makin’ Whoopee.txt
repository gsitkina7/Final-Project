Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopee
Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring
He's washing dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget, folks
Thats what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee
Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee
She sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone her, he doesn't write
He says he's busy, buut she says, "is he?"
He's makin' whoopee
He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, "You'll pay six to her"
He says, "Now judge, suppose I fail?"
The judge say, "Budge right into jail
You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee
You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee"
