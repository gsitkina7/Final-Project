Do you remember when I sang
A-Tisket and A-Tasket
I lost my basket
Oh, yes, we did
We're sorry that you lost it
We'll the pay the cost of it to you
Oh no, you don't have to
I've got good news for you
Just listen while I tell you of a dream come true
I found my yellow basket
Oh yes, I really did
I found the girl who did
I knew just where she did
She said that she was sorry
And gave it back to me
Now I'm oh so happy
Happy as can be
(Are you happy?) Mhm
(Happy) Mhm
I'm so happy I don't know just what to do
And now I'm on my way, feeling light and gay
A-tisket a-tasket, I found my yellow basket
Tisket, tasket, tisket


I'm so happy (Oh, we bet you are)
So happy (Oh, we bet you are)
I'm so happy I don't know just what to do
And now I'm on my way, feeling light and gay
A-tisket a-tasket, I found my yellow basket
Tisket — I'm on my way
Tasket — I'm on my way
Tisket — I'm on my way with my basket
