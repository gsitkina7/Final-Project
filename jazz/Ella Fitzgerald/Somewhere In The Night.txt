Somewhere in the night, chasing shadows around the bend
Somewhere in the night, chasing rainbows that have no end
In the misty night, you are mine and you hold me tight
But dreams have a way of calling it a day
My dreams have past, they seldom last
But in my lonely flight, I'll keep searching till day is through
And somewhere in the night, till I find you
Somewhere in the night
