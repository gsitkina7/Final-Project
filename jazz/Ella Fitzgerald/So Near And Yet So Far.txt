My dear, I've a feeling you are
So near and yet so far
You appear like a radiant star
First so near then again so far
I just start getting you keen
On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far
My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
You turn out to be, oh, so far
I just start getting you keen
On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far
My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
You turn out to be, oh, so far
