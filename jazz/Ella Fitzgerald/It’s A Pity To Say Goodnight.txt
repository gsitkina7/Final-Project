It's a pity to say goodnight
Because I never saw stars so bright
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss
It's a pity to say farewell
Because the man in the moon won't tell
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss
How's about tomorrow night just you and me?
I'll be waiting for you darling
Underneath the apple tree
It's a pity to say goodnight
Because I want you to hold me tight
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss
