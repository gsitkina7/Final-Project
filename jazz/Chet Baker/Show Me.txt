Don't talk of stars, burning above
If you're in love, show me
Tell me not dreams, filled with desire
If you're on fire, show me
Never do I ever want to hear another word
There isn't one, I haven't heard
Here we are together in what ought to be a dream
Say one more word and I'll scream
Sing me no song, read me no rhyme
Don't waste my time, show me
Please don't implore, beg on the seats
Don't make all the speech, show me
Here we are together in the middle of the night
Don't talk of spring, just hold me tight
Anyone who's ever been in love'll tell you that
This is no time for a chat
Haven't your arms, hungered for mine?
Please don't explain, show me, show me
And don't wait until wrinkles and lines
Pop out all over my brow, show me now
Never do I ever want to hear another word
There isn't one, I haven't heard
Here we are together in what ought to be a dream
Say one more word and I'll scream
Haven't your lips longed for my touch?
Don't say how much, show me, show me
Don't wait until wrinkles and lines
Pop out all over my brow, show me now
