I'm travilin light
Because my girl has gone
So from now on
I'm travilin' light
She said "Goodbye"
And took my heart away
So from today
I'm travilin' light
No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories
Some lucky night
She may come back again
So until then
I'm travilin' light
No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories
Some lucky night
Je may come back again
So until then
I'm travilin light
