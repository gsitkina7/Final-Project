I talk to the trees
But they don't listen to me
I talk to the stars
But they never hear me
The breeze hasn't time
To stop and hear what I say
I talk to them all in vain
But suddenly my words
Reach someone else's ear
At someone else's heart strings too
I tell you my dreams
And while you're listening to me
I suddenly see them come true
I can see us some April night
Looking out across a rollin' farm
Having supper in the candlelight
Walking later, arm in arm
Then I'll tell you how I pass the day
Thinking mainly how the night would be
Then I'll try to find the words to say
All the things you mean to me
I tell you my dreams
And while you're listening to me
I suddenly see them come true
