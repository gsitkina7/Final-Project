Almost blue
Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Almost all the things that you promised with your eyes
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Almost blue
Almost touching it will almost do
There's a part of me thats always true... always
All the things that you promised with your eyes
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost you
Almost me
Almost blue
