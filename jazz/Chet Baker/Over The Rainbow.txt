Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
