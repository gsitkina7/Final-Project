Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves, a sycamore..
Moonlight in Vermont
Icy finger waves
Ski trails down a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont
Telegraph cables, that sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont
You and I and moonlight in Vermont
