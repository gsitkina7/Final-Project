Imagination is funny, it makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey just as I think of you
Imagination is crazy, your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy "What to do, what to do?"
Have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss
And then and then, find it's only your imagination again?
Oh, well
Imagination is silly, you go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me, too
