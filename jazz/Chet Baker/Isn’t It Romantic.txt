I've never met you, yet never doubt dear
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss
Just the thing I miss on a night like this
Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard
Isn't it romantic?
Moving shadows write the oldest magic word
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love
Isn't it romantic?
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss
Sweet symbols in the moonlight
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?
Sweet symbols in the moonlight
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?
