I lost at love before
Got mad and closed the door
But you said try just once more
I chose you for the one
Now I'm having so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
The others were untrue
But when it came to lovin' you
I'd spend my whole life with you
'Cause you came and you took control
You touched my very soul
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams
I hear you calling me
I'm so in love with you
All I ever want to do is
Thank you, baby
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
