I get along without you very well, of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves that I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms, of course, I do
But I get along without you very well
I've forgotten you just like I should, of course, I have
Except to hear your name
Or someones laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should
What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store, should I fall once more?
No it's best that I stick to my tune
I get along without you very well, of course, I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two
