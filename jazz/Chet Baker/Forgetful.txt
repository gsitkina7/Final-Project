Lately
You've been so forgetful
A kind of a stop and go forgetfulness
That bothers me
Kisses
I once had a netful
But you've been forgetful
And i'm never kissed
And it bothers me
Romance
Never any romance
No chance
And it bothers me
And someday
When you are regretful
You'll wish you had tried much less forgetfulness
You'll be upset
And forgetful
Won't be able
To forget
