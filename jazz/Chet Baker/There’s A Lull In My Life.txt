Oh, there's a lull in my life
It's just a void and empty space
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life
The moment that you go away
There is no night, there is no day
The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart
That keeps burning, burning
Oh, oh, oh
There's a lull In my life
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can end
The ache in my heart
The call of my arms
The lull in my life
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
