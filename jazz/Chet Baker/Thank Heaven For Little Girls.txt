Each time I see a little girl
Of five or six or seven
I can't resist a joyous urge
To smile and say
Thank Heaven for little girls
For little girls get bigger everyday
Thank Heaven for little girls
They grow up in the most delightful way
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling
Thank Heaven for little girls
Thank Heaven for them all
No matter where, no matter who
Without them what would little boys do?
Thank Heaven
Thank Heaven
Thank Heaven for little girls
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling
Thank Heaven for little girls
Thank Heaven for them all
No matter where, no matter who
Without them what would little boys do?
Thank Heaven
Thank Heaven
Thank Heaven for little girls
Thank Heaven for little girls
