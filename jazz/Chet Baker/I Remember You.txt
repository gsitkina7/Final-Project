Was it in Tahiti?
Were we on the Nile?
Long, long ago, singing our song
I recall that I saw your smile

I Remember You
You're the one
Who made my dreams
Come true
A few kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one
Who said
I love you too
Didn't you know?
I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I remember you


I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I remember you
If they should ask
I'll gladly tell them
I remember you
