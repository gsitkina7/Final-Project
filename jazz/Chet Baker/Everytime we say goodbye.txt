Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
Think so little of me, they allow you to go
When youre near, theres such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it
Theres no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
Minor
Everytime we say goodbye
When youre near, theres such an air of spring about it
