Some folks were meant to live in clover
But they are such a chosen few
And clover being green
Is something I've never seen
'Cause I was born to be blue
When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moon beans I should view
But moon beams being gold
Are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue
When I met you the world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but there is nothing that strikes me funny
Now my worlds a faded past dell
Well, I guess I'm lukier then some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more
Then I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue
When I met you the world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but there's nothing that strikes me funny
Now my worlds a faded past dell
Well, I guess I'm lukier then some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more
Then I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue
