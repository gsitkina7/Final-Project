I've flown around the world in a plane
I've settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
I can't get started with you
Around the golf course
I'm under par
And all the movies asked me to star
I've got a house, a show place
But I can't get no place with you
You're so supreme Lyrics
I write of you, scheme
Just for the sight of you, dream
Both day and night of you
And what good does it do
In 1929 I sold short In England
I'm presented at court
But you've got me down hearted
'Cause I can't get started
With you
