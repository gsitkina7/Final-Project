I've been 'neath the moon before
Held by the charms of other arms
I heard love's old tune before
And it used to bore me 'till you stood before me
You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will?
Why this strange desire?
That keeps mounting higher
When I look at you I can't keep still
You're my thrill
Thrill
