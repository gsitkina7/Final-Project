I could sing a new song
Never sing a blue song
Everything depends on you
I could end my dreaming
Lonely nights of scheming
Everything depends on you
Mountains may be high
Oceans may be wide
But I'll reach the sky with you by my side
I could end my story
In a blaze of Glory
Everything depends on you
Mountains may be high
Oceans may be wide
But I'll reach the sky with you by my side
I could end my story
In a blaze of Glory
Everything depends on you
Everything depends baby
Depends on you
