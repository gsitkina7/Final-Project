Bed, bed, I couldn't go to bed
My head's too light to try to set it down
Sleep, sleep, I couldn't sleep tonight
Not for all the jewels in the crown
I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
I've never done before
I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night
It's after three now
Don't you agree now?
She ought to be in bed
I could have danced all night
(You're tired out, you must be dead)
I could have danced all night
(Your face is drawn, your eyes are red)
And still have begged for more
(Now say goodnight, turn out the light)
(Please, it's really time for you to be in bed)
I could have spread my wings
(Do come along, do as you're told)
And done a thousand things, I've never done before
(Or Mrs. Pierce is apt to stir)
(You're up too late, please, it sure is late)
(Miss, you'll catch a cold)
I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
(Put down your book, the work'll keep)
(Now settle down and go to sleep)
I could have danced, danced, danced all night
I understand, dear
It's all been grand, dear
But now it's time to sleep
I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night and still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things, I'd never done before
I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night
