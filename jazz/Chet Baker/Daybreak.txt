Daybreak, another new day
The mist on the meadow is drifting away
'cause it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now
And flowers break through their blanket of dew
Sunrise, how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on to the blue
At daybreak, I daydream of you
Sunrise, how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on to the blue
At daybreak, I daydream of you
