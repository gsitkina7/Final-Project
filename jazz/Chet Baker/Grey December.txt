Shadows pass my window
Dark and lonely forms
Memories of a fire
Become an ember
Grey December
Listen, can't you hear it?
(?) and listless (?)
Shapeless dreams I try hard
To remember
Grey December
Couldn't you play the role
Lovers do?
And stay
Just for this moment
But love wasn't meant
For sorrow and lament
So I'll do my dreaming alone
Softly, now, I see them
Lovers' arms entwined
Shadows of a love
I can't remember
Now or never
Grey December
