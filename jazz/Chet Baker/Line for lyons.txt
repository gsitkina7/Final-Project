Listen to them play our song
How they shock my poor brain with that electric refrain
I hear a buzzin', just like a dozen doorbells
Everytime I hear our song
I get weak in the knees my heart pumps up a breeze
Sending a stream to every extremity
Parts of my anatomy are not controlled by me
The music's magic spell
Leaves me a mess of quivering jelly
Even on a violin
How those sweet dulcet tones pull marrow out of my bones
I must confess, it leaves me a mess, our song
 
Parts of my anatomy are not controlled by me
The music's magic spell
Leaves me a mess of quivering jelly
Even on a violin
How those sweet dulcet tones pull marrow out of my bones
I must confess, it leaves me a mess, our song does
I love to hear our song 'cause
It grooves me so our song
