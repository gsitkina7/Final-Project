When the sunset in the sky
And flowers never die, babe
Friends don't pass you by
But that's my home

When the folks say, "How de do?"
Like they mean it, too, girl
Where mammy's love is true
Well, that's my home
I'm always welcomed back
No matter where I roam, always welcome
Just a little shack to me
Is home sweet home

Where the Suwannee River flows
The shady pine trees grow
I needn't say no more
Cause that's my home
