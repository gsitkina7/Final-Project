I bet there's a lotta hoboes Lord set on them rods
Even A-number one and all 'em cats, yeath man
All aboard for Pittsburgh, Harrisburg oh all the burgs
Hobo, you can't ride this train
Now I'm the brakeman and I'm a tough man
I ain't jokin' you, can't ride this train
Boys, you ain't so bad
After all you all right with me
I think I will let you ride
