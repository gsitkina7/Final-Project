Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
A sweep is as lucky, as lucky can be
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-oo!
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you
Or blow me a kiss and that’s lucky too
Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey
Now, as the ladder of life has been strung
You may think a sweep’s on the bottommost rung
Though I spend my time in the ashes and that hm-hmm
In this whole wide world there’s no happier cat
Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do
A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flute
Though I’m covered in soot from my head to my toe
A sweep knows he’s welcome where’er he goes
Chim chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
’en you’re with a sweep, you’re in good com’any
Nowhere there’s a more happy crew
Than them that sings chim cham chim cher-oo
Chim-in-ey chim-ee cher-oo chim-cher-ee!
