On a coconut island
I'd like to be a castaway with you
On a coconut island
There wouldn't be so very much to do
I would linger a while and just gaze into your lovely eyes so blue
Then I'd walk for a mile and come running back to be with you
There the waves would make a pair of willing slaves of you and me forever
And we'd laze for days and days and never gaze out where the ships go sailing by
On a coconut island
I'd like to be a castaway with you
Just to bask in your smile
And to realize my dream come true
I would linger a while and just gaze into your lovely eyes so blue
Then I'd walk for a mile and come running back to be with you
There the waves would make a pair of willing slaves of you and me forever
And we'd laze for days and days and never gaze out where the ships go sailing by
