Out on the plains, down near Santa Fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along, I heard him singin'
A most peculiar cowboy song
It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Now get along, get hip, little dogies
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip, little dogies
He trucked 'em on down that old fairway
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Now singin' his cowboy songs, he's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a Dixie touch
He was raised on Loco weed
He's what you call a swing in half breed
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah, playboy
Singin' his cowboy songs, he's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a Dixie touch
He was raised on Loco weed
He's what you call a swing half breed
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
