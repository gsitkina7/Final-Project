Who invented music?
I'd like to shake his hand
'Cause music casts a spell on me
That I can't understand
Must be some magician
Designed a magic plan
He changed his wand to a baton
And that's how it all began
When the rhythm pounds
And the harmony sounds
And the melody rolls around
(spoken) "Prest-o Change-o!"
We're ten feet off the ground
And when the rhythm pounds
And the harmony sounds
And the melody rolls around
Right from the down beat
We can be found
When everybody puts his heart in it
Everybody plays a part in it
That's how music magic is made
Everybody's toe's get tap-ier
Everybody's feeling happier
Lighter than air
Out of his chair
When the rhythm pounds
And the harmony sounds
And the melody rolls around
(spoken) "Prest-o Change-o!"
He's ten feet off the ground
(Music interlude)
Who invented music?
We'd like to shake his hand
(Music interlude)
That's how music magic is made
Oh, ten feet off the ground
(Music interlude)
That's how music magic is made
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Lighter than air
Out of his chair
Oh!
Right from the down beat, we can be found
Floating along on a musical sound
Out of this world and out the world bound
Ten feet
Everybody puts his heart in it
Everybody plays a part in it
That's how music magic is made
Everybody's toe's get tap-ier
Everybody's feeling happier
Lighter than air
Out of his chair
