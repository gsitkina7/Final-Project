Ramona
Ramona, I hear the mission bells above
Ramona , they're ringing out our song of love
I press you, caress you
And bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember
The rambling rose you wore in your hair
Ramona, when the day is done you'll hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the waterfall
I dread the dawn
When I awake to find you gone
Ramona, I need you, my own
Ramona, when the day is done you'll hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the waterfall
I dread the dawn
When I awake to find you gone
Ramona, I need you, my own
