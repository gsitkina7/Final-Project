They took the moonlight out of the skies
And put the moonlight right in your eyes
Like a june night
You're a heavenly thing
They took the fragrance out of the dew
And sprinkled roses all over you
Like a garden
You're a heavenly thing
They made a clinging vine
Your embrace
Stars that shine light your face
To combine everything
On your lips they put the breath of spring
And then they finished called it a day
They took the model threw it away
Like an angel
You're a heavenly thing
