I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to feel low down
I gotta right to hang around
Down around the river
A certain gal in this old town
Keeps draggin' my poor heart around
And all I see for me, misery
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan and sigh
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
I know the deep blue sea
Mama, will be callin' me
It must be love say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues
