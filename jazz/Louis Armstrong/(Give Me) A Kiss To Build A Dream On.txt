Give me a kiss to build a dream on
And my imagination
Will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this
A kiss to build a dream on
Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination
Will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part
A kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies
I'll be with you
Weaving romances
Making believe they're true
Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
And my imagination
Will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on

Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination
Will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part
A kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies
I'll be with you
Weaving romances
Making believe they're true
Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
And my imagination
Will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on
