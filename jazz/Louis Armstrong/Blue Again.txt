Blue again, blue again
And you darn well it's you again
You said last night we were through again
And now I'm blue again
I'm alone again, alone again
I'm out around on my own again
There's a mocking bird that's flown again
And I'm alone again
Now baby, though I said I hate you
I love you more everyday, babe
Though I aggravate you
All that I'm dyin' to say that it's new again
You again and we'll meet today
At half past two again
And tonight we'll fight again
And I'll be blue again
