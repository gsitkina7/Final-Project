Red, oh
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me, baby
He sailed at the dawning; all the day I've been blue, baby
Red sails in the sunset, I'm trusting in you
Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We marry tomorrow
And he goes sailing no more
Red sails in the sunset, baby, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me
