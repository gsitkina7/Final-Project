They say fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly
I'm gonna love one man till the day I die
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine, no, no
They tell me he's lazy, they try to tell me he's slow
Tell me he's crazy, ooh, but maybe I know
Well, but I just can't help, ooh, lovin' dat man of mine
Oh, when he goes away, that's a gloomy day
And when he comes back that day
I know the sun is gonna shine
He can come home just as late as can be
'Cause home without a man just ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine
