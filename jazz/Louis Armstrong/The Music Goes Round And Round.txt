Nah, you blow through here
The music goes down and around
And it comes out here
Nah, you push the first valve down
The music goes down and around
And it comes out here
Oh, you push the middle valve down
The music goes down around below
Listen to the jazz come out
Push the other valve down
The music goes down and around
And it comes out here
