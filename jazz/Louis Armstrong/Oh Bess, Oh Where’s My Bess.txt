Bess, oh where's my Bess
Won't somebody tell me where?
I don't care what she says
I don't care what she's done
Won't somebody tell me where is my Bess?
Bess, Oh, Lawd
My Bess! I want her now
Widout her I can't go on
I counted de days dat I was gone
Till I got home to see her face
Won't somebody tell me where is my Bess?
Oh, I want her so, my gal, my Bess, where is she?
Oh Lawd, in your big Heaven
Please show me where I mus' go
Oh give me de strength, show me de way!
Tell me de truth, where is she, where is my gal
Where is my Bess!
