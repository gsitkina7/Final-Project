Although you said we're through, babe
I'll always love you
You know you can depend on me
Now, mama, though someone you've met
Has made you forget, babe
You know you can count on me
Now, honey, I wish you success, loads of happiness
Now, baby, I must confess
I'll be lonely, I'll be lonely, I'll be lonely
If you ever need a friend, babe
I'll be yours till the end
You know you can depend on me
