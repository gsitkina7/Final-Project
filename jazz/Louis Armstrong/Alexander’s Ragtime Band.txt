Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
The best band in the land
They can play a bugle call
Like you never heard before
So natural that you want to go to war
It's just the bestest band whatever Honey Lamb
Come on along, come on along
Let me take you by the hand
To the man, to meet the man
Who's the leader of the band
And if you want to hear that Swanee River
Played in a ragtime
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Come on and hear that
Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on along, come on along
Let me take you by the hand
To the man, to meet the man
Who's the leader of the band
And if you want to hear that Swanee River
Played in a ragtime
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Come on and hear that
Alexander's Ragtime Band
