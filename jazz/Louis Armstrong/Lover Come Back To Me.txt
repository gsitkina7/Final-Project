The sky was blue and high above
Oh, the moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine keeps singin'
Oh lover, come back to me
You came at last, you know love had his day
That day has past, you've gone away
This eager heart of mine keeps singin', baby
Lover, please come on back to me
You know I remember every little thing you used to do
I’m so lonely
Every road I walk along, I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
Oh, the sky was blue and high above
 the moon was new and so was love
And while I’m waiting here
This heart of mine keeps singing
Lover, lover, lover, oh yeah
I remember every little thing you used to do
I’m so lonely
Oh, every road I walk along, I walk along with you
No, no, no, no wonder I am lonely
Oh, the sky was blue and high above
 the moon was new and so was love
And while I’m waiting here
This heart of mine keeps singing
Oh, lover, come back, oh, lover, come back
Lover, come back to me
Oh lover, come back, oh, lo-lo-lover, come back
Lover, come back to me
