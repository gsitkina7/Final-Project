Yes, I ain't got nobody, baby
And there's nobody cares for me
Mm, I'm so sad and lonely, baby, yeah
Won't someone take a chance with me?

I'll sing my love song, I sing it all the time
Won't some of you hot mama's run here and sorta just be mine?
Yes I, I ain't got nobody, baby, yes
Baby, nobody, nobody cares for me
