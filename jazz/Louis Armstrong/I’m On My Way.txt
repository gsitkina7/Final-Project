On my way now, got on my traveling shoes
Well, I'm on my way now, got on my traveling shoes
Them shoes now, got on my traveling shoes
Oh, child got on my traveling shoes
Well, I went to the church, I walked right in
The saints began to pray and the Lord came in
I went to the alter, didn't find a fault
The saints began to pray and the fires did halt
Well, I went to the valley, didn't go to stay
My soul got empty and I stayed all day
I went to the river and walked right in
The saints were all saying, "wash away your sins"

On my way now, got on my traveling shoes
Yes, I'm on my way now, got on my traveling shoes
Goin' home now, got on my traveling shoes
Goin' home now, got on my traveling shoes
I'm on my way now, got on my traveling shoes
On my way
Yes, I'm about to leave you on my way
I'm wearing my traveling shoes on my way
Yes, I'm going home where things are always good
