I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I'm plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while, baby
You're sure to find happiness and I guess
All those things that you've pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you lookin' swell, baby
Diamond bracelets, woolworths doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day, lucky day you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
