Wave your little hand and whisper
So long, dearie, you ain't gonna see me any more
But when you discover that your life is dreary
Don't you come a-knocking on my door
For I'll be all dolled up and singing that song
That says, you dog, I told you so
So wave your little hand and whisper
So long, dearie, dearie, should have said
So long, so long ago
For I can hear that choo-choo calling me on
To a fancy new address
Yes, I can hear that choo-choo calling me on
On board the Happiness Express
I'm pick myself a chick
Who's gonna stick like glue
I don't care where I'm going
As long as it's away from you, honey, ha, ha, ha
Yes, so long, dearie
You ain't gonna see me any more, yeah
Yes, so long, Dolly
Don't you come a-knocking on my door
For I'll be all dolled up and singing that song
That says, you dog, I told you so
Yeah, wave your little hand and whisper
So long, Louis, Louis should have said
So long, so long ago
