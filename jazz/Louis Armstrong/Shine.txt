Oh chocolate drop, that's me
'Cause my hair is curly
Just because my teeth are pearly
Just because I always wear a smile
Like to dress up, in the latest style
'Cause I'm glad I'm livin'
I take troubles all with a smile
Just because my color's shady
Different maybe, that's why they call me
My teeth are pearly
Just because
Oh baby, that's why they call me Shine
