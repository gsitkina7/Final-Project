Keepin' out of mischief now
I really am in love and how
I'm through playin' with fire
It's you whom I desire
All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me
I have told them in advance
They can't break up our romance
Livin' up to all my vows
'Cause I'm keepin' out mischief now
Keepin' out of mischief now
I really am in love and how
I'm through playin' with fire
It's you whom I desire
All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me
I have told them in advance
They can't break up our romance
Livin' up to all my vows
'Cause I'm keepin' out mischief
Oh, yeah
Keepin' out of mischief
Oh, yeah
Keepin' out of mischief now
