You look at me and then a song begins
Played on a million velvet violins
My head goes reelin' and around it spins
Fantastic, fantastic that's you, yes
You whisper darlin' and before my eyes
A blaze of fireworks light up the skies
My heart grows wings then away it flies
Fantastic, fantastic that's you
You perform miracles
Whenever you hold me near
Tender, warm miracles
That make me surrender dear, yes
And when you kiss me heaven opens wide
And there you are inviting me inside
No wonder angels up there have staring eyes
Fantastic, fantastic that's you
Yes, and when you kiss me heaven opens wide
And there you are inviting me inside
No wonder angels up there have staring eyes
Fantastic, fantastic that's you
