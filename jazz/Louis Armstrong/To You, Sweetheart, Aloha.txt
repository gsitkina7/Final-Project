To you, sweetheart, aloha
Aloha from the bottom of my heart
Keep the smile on your lips
Brush the tear from your eye
One more aloha then it's time for goodbye
To you, sweetheart, aloha
In dreams I'll be with you, dear, tonight
And I'll pray for that day when
We two will meet again
Until then, sweetheart, aloha
