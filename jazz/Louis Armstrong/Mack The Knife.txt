Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And he shows them, a-pearly white
Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears Macheath, dear
So thereâ€™s not a trace, mmm, of red
On the sidewalk, Sunday mornin', baby
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone sneakin' 'round the corner
Is the someone Mack the Knife?
From a tugboat by the river, baby
A cement bag's drooppin' down
Yeah the cement's just for the weight, dear
Bet you Mack, he's back in town
Lookie here, Louie Miller, disappeared, dear
After drawing out his cash
And MacHeath spends like a sailor
Did our boy do somethin' rash?
Suky Tawdry, Jenny Diver
Lotte Lenya, sweet Lucy Brown
Yes, the line forms on the right, dears
Now that Mackheath's back in town
Take it, Satch
