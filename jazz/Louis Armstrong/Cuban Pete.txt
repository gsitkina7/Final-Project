You've been to the dancing shows
You've seen how the rumba goes
What rhythm, fascinating rhythm
Havana brings news to you
They've just introduced a new sensation
A dancing creation
They call him Cuban Pete
He's the king of the rumba beat
When he plays the maracas he goes
Chick-chicky-boom
Chick-chicky-boom
Yes sir, he's Cuban Pete
He's the craze of his native street
When he plays the maracas he goes
Chick-chicky-boom
Chick-chicky-boom
The senoritas they sing
And how they swing with his sombrero
He's very nice, so full of spice
And to the music they bring
A happy ring, never a care-o
Singing a song, all the day long
Hey, hey, for Cuban Pete
He's the king of the rumba beat
When he plays the maracas he goes
Chick-chicky-boom
Chick-chicky-boom
