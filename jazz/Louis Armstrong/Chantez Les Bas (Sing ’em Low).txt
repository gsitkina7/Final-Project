Down in Louisiana, Louisiana - Land of Creole Sues
Patois, Mardi Gras and romantic blues
Once I hard a lover, when work was over strum a Creole croone
To his wherein lovey dovey underneath a Dixie Moon. I heard her say
Chantez-les bas, that means in Creole - sing 'em low. Yeah
Chantez-les bas. She liked her blues played sweetly and slow, yeah
Chantez-les bas. I can't forget that serenade, and if you listen to me
Just a while, I'll try to sing for you what they say: Oh in the mornin' baby
Jes' fore day, in the mornin'
Jes' fore day, in the mornin'
Jes' fore day, and New Orleans, hey, hey! Oh in the mornin' baby
Jes' fore day, in the mornin'
Jes' fore day, in the mornin'
Jes' fore day, I'll come to get you and take you away, far, far away
