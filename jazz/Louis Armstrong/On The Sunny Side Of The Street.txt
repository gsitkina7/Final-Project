Grab your coat and grab your hat baby
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
On the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear that pitter-pat there?
That happy tune is yours now
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid baby
My rover, crossed over
If I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
