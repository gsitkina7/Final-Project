Now, I don't care what the weather man says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining, I'm certain the sun will shine
I don't care how the weather vane points
When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me, when your eyes look into mine
Jeepers Creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers Creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all git up, how'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all git up, how'd they get that size?
Golly gee! When you turn those heaters on, woe is me
Got to get my cheaters on, Jeepers Creepers
Where'd ya get those peepers? On, those weepers
How they hypnotize, where'd ya get those eyes?
Where'd ya get those eyes? Where'd ya get those eyes?
