Ooh, I want a little girl
To call my own
Must be someone who's all alone
Just a little girl to fall in love with me, ooh, yeah
Want a little girl
She may not look like the picture in a storybook
But if she can cook
She'll suit me to a T
She don't have to wave her hair
Or dress in fancy clothes
Ooh, and I wouldn't even care
If she didn't wear second hose, ohh, yes
Want a little girl to love a lot
I'd give anything that I've got
For a little girl
Oh, to fall in love with me
