E'er since Miss Susan Johnson lost her Jockey, Lee
There has been much excitement, more to be
You can hear her moaning night and morn
Wonder where my easy rider's gone?
Cable grams come of sympathy
Telegrams go of inquiry
Letters come from down in, 'Bam'
And everywhere that Uncle Sam
Has even a rural delivery
All day the phone rings but it's not for me
At last good tidings fill our hearts with glee
This message comes from Tennessee
Dear Sue, your easy rider struck this burg today
On a south-bound rattler side door Pullman car
Seen him here an' he was on the hog
Spoken the smoke was broke, no joke, not a jitney on him
Easy rider's gotta stay away
So he had to vamp it but the hike ain't far
He's gone where the southern cross' the Yellow Dog
I know the Yellow Dog district like a book
Indeed I know the route that rider took
Ev'ry cross tie, bayou, burg and bog
Way down where the southern cross' the Dog
Money don't zactly grow on trees
On cotton stalks it grows with ease
No race horse, race track, no grand stand
Is like old beck and buckshot land
Down where the southern cross' the Dog
Every kitchen there is a cabaret
Down there the Boll Weevil works while the darkies play
This Yellow Dog blues the live long day
Dear Sue, your easy rider struck this burg today
On a south-bound rattler side door Pullman car
Seen him here an' he was on the hog
Spoken the smoke was broke, no joke, not a jitney on him
Easy rider's gotta stay away
So he had to vamp it but the hike ain't far
He's gone where the southern cross' the Yellow Dog
