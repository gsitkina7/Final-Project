I was doing all right
Nothing but rainbows in my skies
I was doing all right
Till you came by
Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
Until you came by
But now whenever you're away
Can't sleep at nights and I suffer all day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder
But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing better than ever now
Now whenever you're away
Can't sleep at nights and I suffer all day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder
But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing a little better than ever now
