People watch your step inside
The party's just startin' to roll
Grab a soda pop and hit that potato chip bowl
Put on a record and go
Get a piece of the flow
I'll be right back
I'm gonna answer the door
Hello everybody it's great to see you
Why don't you come on in?
I gotta say you're looking fine
Hey Sally, how about a spin?
Take off your shoes and shake off your blues and cares
Let's call the neighbors and tell them to bring more chairs
I like this kind of party
Free and easy, this kind of party
I like this kind of party
Everybody's movin' and everybody's groovin'
I like this kind of party
A meser√©, swingin', friends all a-singin'!
Gee you better call the baby-sitter
And say you'll be late!
When you're finished doin' that you better come back here an'
Pile up your plate!
Oh! Listen to Charlie Boy teach that piano to play!
Hey! Let's turn up your music and dance the night away!
Yeah ladies. I like this kind of party!
Free an' easy, kind of party!
I like this kind of party
'Cuz everybody's movin' and everybody's groovin'
I like this kind of party
I like, this kind, of party!
