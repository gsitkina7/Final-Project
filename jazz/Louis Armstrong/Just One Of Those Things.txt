It was just one of those things, just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings, just one of those things
It was just one of those nights, just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings, just one of those things
If we´d thought of it, of the end of it, when we started painting the town
We´d have been aware that our love affair was too hot not to cool down
So goodbye, dear, and Amen, here´s hoping we´ll meet now and then
It was great fun but it was just one of those things
Just one of those things, mamma just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings, just one of those things
One of those nights, just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings, mamma just one of those things
If we´d thought of it, of the end of it, when we started painting that town
We´d have been aware that our love affair was too hot not to cool down
So goodbye, dear, and Amen, here´s hoping we´ll meet now and then
It was great fun but it was just one of those things
