The tables are empty
The dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song
It's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning
Just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson
In learnin' the Blues
The cigarettes you light
One after another
Won't help you forget him
And the way that you loved him
You're only burning
A torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track
For learnin' the blues
When you're at home alone
The blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd
The Blues will haunt your memory
The nights when you don't sleep
The whole night you're cryin'
But you can't forget him
Soon you even stop tryin'
You walk the floor
And wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break
You're learnin' the blues
Yes, the tables are empty
The dance floor's deserted
And you play the same love song, whoa, yes
It's the tenth time you've heard it, yes
Man, it's the beginnin'
Just one of those clues
You've had your first lesson, whoa, yes
In learnin' the Blues
Man, the cigarettes that you light, whoa, yes sum
One after another, you tellin' me brother
Won't help you to forget her, whoa, no
And the way that you love her
You only burnin'
A torch that you can't lose, yeah
But you on the right tracks, brother
For learnin' the blues
D'ya see that Ella?
Now look a here, when you at home alone
The blues will taunt you constantly, yes suh
And when you're out in a crowd
The blues will haunt your memories
The nights when you don't sleep, yes
The whole night you cryin'
But you can't forget her, oh yes
Soon you even stop tryin'
Man, you walk the floor
And wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break, yeah brother
That's when you're learnin' the blues
Yes, when you at home alone
The blues will taunt you constantly, yes
And when you're out in a crowd
The blues will haunt your memories
The nights when you don't sleep, Ella
The whole night you're crying

Soon you even stop trying
Yes, man, you'll walk the floor, that's when it's rough
And wear out that last pair a' treaders, ha ha
When you feel your, heart break
You're learnin' the blues
