Now, I'm flyin' high but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
Mama, you caught my eye and I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Show me the ring and I'll jump right through
I used to travel single-o, we chanced to mingle-o
Now I'm a tingle over you
Hey, Mister Parson stand by, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
