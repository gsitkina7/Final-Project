I saw you standing in the sun and you were something to see
I know what I liked and I liked what I saw
And I said to myself, that's for me
A lovely morning, I remarked, and you were quick to agree
You wanted to walk and I nodded my head
As I breathlessly said, that's for me
I left you standing under stars, the day's adventures are through
There's nothing for me but the dream in my heart
And the dream in my heart, that's for you
Oh my darling, that's for you
I left you standing under stars, the day's adventures are through
There's nothing for me but the dream in my heart
And the dream in my heart, that's for you
Oh my darling, that's for you
