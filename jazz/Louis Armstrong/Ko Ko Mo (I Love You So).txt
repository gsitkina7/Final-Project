(Ko-Ko-Mo! Ko-Ko-Mo! Ko-Ko-Mo!)
Talk to me baby, whisper in my ear
A come a little closer, don't you have no fear!
Don't you know? I love you so!
Don't you know? I love you so!
When I holler "Hey! Ko-Ko-Mo!"
Heard what you told me, heard what you said!
Heard what you told me, heard what you said!
Don't you worry my purdy, I don't lose my head!
There's dimples on my elbows, dimples on her knees
Dimples on my elbows, dimples on her knees
She thrills an' thrills me, just a little squeeze!
(Ko, Ko, Ko-Ko-Mo! Ko, Ko, Ko-Ko-Mo!
Ko, Ko, Ko-Ko-Mo!)
Don't you know Ko-Ko-Mo that I love you so!
Oh talk to me baby (talk, talk!) whisper in my ear (talk, talk, talk!)
Oh talk to me baby (talk, talk!) whisper in my ear (talk, talk, talk!)
(Tell it to me!) come a little closer, don't you have no fear!
Ah! Don't you know? I love you so!
Don't you know? ~ I love you so!
When I holler "Hey! ( Hey! ) Ko-Ko-Mo!"
(Ko-Ko-Mo! Ko-Ko-Mo! Ko-Ko-Mo!)
Don't you know
I love you Ko-Ko-Mo!
Ko-Ko-Mo!
