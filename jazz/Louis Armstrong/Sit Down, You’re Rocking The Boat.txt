Now look here don't be singin' that pretty music for me
I've learned my lesson and I ain't ready to go yet
Let me tell you all about it
I dreamed last night I got on the boat to Heaven
And by some chance I had brought my dice along
And there I stood, and I hollered, "Someone fade me"
But the passengers they knew right from wrong
For the people all said
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"
And the people all said
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"
"And the devil will drag you under
By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rocking the boat"
Now I sailed away on that little boat to Heaven
And by some chance found a bottle in my fist
And there I stood nicely passin' out the whiskey
But the passengers were bound to resist
For the people all said
"Beware, you are on a heavenly trip"
People all said
"Beware, beware you'll scuttle the ship"
"And the devil will drag you under
By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat"
Now as I laughed at those passengers to Heaven
A great big wave came and washed me overboard
And as I sank, and I hollered, "Someone save me"
That's the moment I woke up, thank the Lord
And I said to myself
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"
I said to myself
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"
"And the devil will drag you under
With a soul so heavy you'd never float
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat"
Sit down you're rockin' the boat
Sit down you're rockin' the boat
And I ain't gonna rock it no more
