Oh two by two
They go marching through
Oh sweethearts on parade
And how i cried
As they passed me by
Those sweethearts on parade
I'd love to join them but
Well they won't even look
Cause it takes more than one to join the army of love
So how i pine
Just to fall in line
With those sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
Sweethearts on parade
