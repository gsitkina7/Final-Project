Now the pale moon's shining on the fields below
The folks are crooning soft and low
You needn't tell me, boy, because I know, yes
When it's sleepy time down south
Yes, the soft wind blowing through the pinewood trees
The folks down there live a life of ease
When old mammy falls on her knees, yes
When it's sleepy time down south

Yes, steamboats on the river coming and going
Splashing the night away
You hear those banjos ringing and the folks are singing
And they dance 'til the break of day, yes
Dear old southland with his dreamy song
You take me back where I belong
Right in my mammy's arms
Yes, good evening everybody, good evening, hahahaha
