Drop me off in Harlem
Yea, good ol' Harlem
You have your fun
Under the Harlem sun
So drop me off in Harlem
There's Duke Ellington up in Harlem
He writes all his tunes in Harlem
And old Satchmo's still swingin'
Way up in Harlem
All the cats
Are still up there
They're beatin' out those riffs
And Apollo of Puerto Rico
Will give you a great big lisp
Yes, drop me off in Harlem
Yea man, beautiful Harlem
You get 
It's very nice
Way up there in Harlem
