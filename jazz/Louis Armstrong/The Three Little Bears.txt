Now, once upon a time, in a neat little cottage
There lived three bears
One was a daddy bear and one was a mamma bear
And one was a wee bear
One day when out walking
In the deep woods was stalking
Came a little gal with blonde hair
Now, her name was Goldilocks
And upon their door she knocked
But no one was there
So she walked right in and had herself a time
'Cause she didn't care
Soon she got sleepy, went to bed upstairs, when
Home, home, home came the three bears
Someone's been eating my porridge
Said the daddy bear
Someone's been eating my porridge
Said the mamma bear
Hey-bubba-rebear, said the little wee bear
Who's broken my chair?
Someone's been sleeping in my bed, said the daddy bear
Oh, someone's been sleeping in my bed, said the mamma bear
Bear-bubba-rebear, said the little wee bear
Who's broken my chair?
Just then, Goldilocks woke up
Broke up the party and beat it out there
Bye-bye, bye, bye, said the daddy bear
Goodbye, bye, said the mamma bear
Hey bubba-rebear, said the wee bear
So ends the story of the three bears
Just then, Goldilocks woke up
Broke up the party and beat it out there
Bye-bye, bye, bye, said the daddy bear
Goodbye, bye, said the mamma bear
Hey bubba-rebear, said the wee bear
So ends the story of the three bears
So, don't forget children, whatever you do
Don't go down to the woods tonight
Because the bears'll get ya!
