Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Of mother nature's recipies
That bring the bare necessities of life
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I can't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzing in the trees
To make some honey just for me
You look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few
The bare necessities of life will come to you
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your stife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
So just relax, yeah
In my backyard
If you act like that bee acts
You're workin' too hard
Don't spend your time, just lookin' around
For something you want, can't be found
You find out you can live without it
And go along, not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you, they'll come to you
They'll come to you, oh yes
