Just kiss me once and kiss me twice, then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear, since can't remember when
It's been a long, long time

You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice, then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Yes, kiss me once, kiss me twice, kiss me once again
It's a-been a long, long, a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear, since can't remember when
It's been a long, long time

You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once and kiss me twice, kiss me once again
It's been a long, ba-ba-ba-boo time
Oh yeah
