Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
I couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
Yes, they'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Yes darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up on memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
Yeah da di de
Heard they crowded the floor, baby
Don't get around much anymore, baby
I thought I'd visit the club
And got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Oh darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
Yes but nevertheless why stir up on memories
Been invited to dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
