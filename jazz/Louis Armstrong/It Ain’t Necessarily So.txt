It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
The things that you're liable
To read in the Bible
It ain't necessarily so
Little David was small but oh, my
Little David was small but oh, my
He fought the Goliath who lay down and dieth
Little David was small but oh, my
Yes, Jonah he lived in the whale
Oh, Jonah he lived in the whale
But he made his home in that fish's abdomen
Ooh, Jonah he lived in the whale
Little Moses was found in the stream
Little Moses was found in the stream
He floated on water till old Pharoah's daughter
She fished him she says from that stream
It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
They tell all the children
The devil's a villian
But it ain't necessarily so
To get into heaven don't snap for a seven
Live clean, don't have no fault
Oh, I'd take that gospel whenever it's possible
But with a grain of salt
 don't live nine hundred years
 don't live nine hundred years
But who calls that livin' when no gal will give in
To no man, what's nine hundred years?
Now I'm preachin' this sermon to 
It ain't necessarily, ain't necessarily, ain't necessarily so
