Woke up one bright morning
Woke up in the rain
Woke up to the sunshine and the pain
Stood out in the rosebuds
Stood out in the dew
Stood out in the clear and got a clue--
Listen to the mockingbird
Sing his sweet song
Listen to the mockingbird
And know that life goes on
Been inside a coal mine
Been inside a whale
Been inside a grief just like a jail...
Listen to the mockingbird
Sing his sweet song
Listen to the mockingbird
And know that life goes on
On that morning, dressed in black
I began my journey back;
Through old cobwebs colors blew
From my footsteps shadows flew--
Through these eyes of light now
I begin to know
All good things in time will come and go--
Listen to the mockingbird
Sing his sweet song
Listen to the mockingbird
And know that life goes on
