Tank fly boss walk jam nitty-gritty
You're listening to the boy from the big bad city
This is jam hot
This is jam hot
Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
That's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me
People always talk about reputation
I don't care about your other girls
(Just be good to me)
(Just be good to me)

Love is a game of chances
So I'll take my chance with you
And you boy won't ever change
We talk about it and I'd
Rather have a piece of you
Than all or nothing
(Just be good to me)
In the morning
(Just be good to me)
In the afternoon all evening
(Just be good to me)
Yeah, just be good to me
(Just be good to me)
(Just be good to me)
I am not the jealous kind
I won't tie you down
When you need me
I'll be around
(Just be good to me)
I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
We could be together
Be together
(Just be good to me)
(Just be good to me)
(Just be good to me)
