You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
Now it's too sad, it's too bad that I'm in love with you
First you love me, then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm in love with you
Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues every night
Since I fell for you, oh yeah
Yes, it's too sad, it's too bad that I'm in love with you
First you love me, then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm in love with you
Oh, I know someday you will be sorry
The way that you mistreated me
The day I fell for you, oh yeah
