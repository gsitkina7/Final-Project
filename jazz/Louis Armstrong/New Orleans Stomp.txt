Yeeeeeessss, New Orleans
The land of beautiful queens
The prettiest skies you've ever seen
They'll tell you:
Yakkity, yakkity
Yakkity, yakkity yak
In New Orleans
(My home town, ya know)
The land of the red beans
Don't forget those ham and greens
Down in New Orleans
(More Awesome Trumpeting)
(And some other instruments, too, I guess)
(Oh! There's the Trumpet again! Sweet!)
(Preach it, Louis!)
(Aw man, the song's over!)
