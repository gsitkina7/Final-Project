Last night I dreamed of you
Of your dear smile and eyes all blue
If only my dreams come true
I'll be so glad my whole life through
Last night I was dreaming
I dreamed that that you kissed me
While bright stars were beaming
I dreamed that you kissed me
When I awoke with the break of dawn
Oh, I longed to go dreaming on
You had gone far while I was dreaming
I dreamed that you kissed me
And I awoke with the break of dawn
Oh, I longed to go dreaming on
You had gone far while I was dreaming
I dreamed that you kissed me
