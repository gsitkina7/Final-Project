The other night, about twelve o'clock
I thought I'd go downstairs just to check the lock
When I heard something in the house
I don't mean a mouse
I swear they were spooks, spooks, spooks
I know they were spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I couldn't move, just stood and stared
I never was so scared
The first spook spoke and I heard him speak
He said, "What say I go make the back door squeak?"
Oh he would tease the cat and hound the pup
And raise our spirits up
Oh lordy, them spooks, spooks, spooks
Those scary old spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
You don't have to take my word
But I heard what I heard

The next spook spoke, he said, "Suppose we make
The faucets drip and make the shutters shake
You let me know just what you want
This is my favourite haunt"
Beware of them spooks, spooks, spooks
Them mischevous spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I ain't spoofing, man I mean
That I seen what I seen

A big spook spoke, he said, "Spike, my son," he said
"I'll show you how to scare up some fun
But next time when you wail, see here
You make it loud and clear"
Watch out for them spooks, spooks, spooks
Oh them nasty old spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
Maybe you don't think it's so
But I knew what I knew
The last spook turned to his spouse and frowned
Said, "I thought I'd told you to wait in the ground
But you look awful cute tonight
In fact, you look a fright"

He's talking 'bout spooks, spooks, spooks
Real genuine spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
Oh, you stop putting up your dukes
You just can't fight with them spooks
I'm getting outta here, man
I don't dig this jive, no

Wait for us, wait for us, wait for us, wait for us
