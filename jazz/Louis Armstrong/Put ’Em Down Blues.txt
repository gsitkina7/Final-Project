Let him put you down, if he dares
I'll pick you up by myself just as soon
I don't care, you never rest on the shelf
I've been looking for a girl like you so long
A girl so nice and gentle with a love that's strong
I'll make life for you, one grand sweet song
Oh, give me a break, sweet mama and you can't go wrong
I for you, you for me
That's the only way two loving hearts should be
So just be glad when he puts you down
I'll pick you up all myself
