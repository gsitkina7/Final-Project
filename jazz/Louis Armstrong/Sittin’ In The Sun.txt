Sittin' in the sun counting my money
Fanned by my summer-breeze
Sweeter than the honey is counting my money
Those greenbacks on the trees
Comes the summer shower , drops of rain falling
Sweeter than the Christmas chimes
And hearing those jingles upon the roof shingles
Like pennies, nickels and dimes
Though it's known that what I own
Is not a large amount
Fields of gold that I behold
Are in my bank-account
Yeah , sitting in the sun
Counting my money
Happy as I can be
And to top it all when shadows fall
I look to heaven and I see
There's a silver dollar
In the sky shining down on me
Yeah , sittin' in the sun
Counting my money
Happy as I can be
And to top it all when shadows fall
I look to heaven and I see
There's a silver dollar
In the sky shining down on me
