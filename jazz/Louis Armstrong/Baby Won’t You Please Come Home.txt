I've got the blues, I feel so lonely
I'd give the world if I could only
Make you understand
It truly would be grand
I'm gonna telephone my baby
Ask him won't you please come home
Oh, when you gone
I'm worried all day long
Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home
I have tried in vain
Nevermore to call your name
When you left you broke my heart
That will never make us part
Every hour in the day
You will hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home
I mean, baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home
'Cause your mama's all alone
I have tried in vain
Nevermore to call your name
When you left you broke my heart
That will never make us part
Landlord's gettin' worse
I gotta move May the first
Baby, won't you please come home
I need money
Baby, won't you please come home
