As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my anties
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's
So my dear I swore, "Never, never more !"
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out
Now, I find I was blind, and old lady, how I lost out !
I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years ?
Little wow, tell me now :
How long has this been going on ?
There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen, sweet, I repeat :
How long has this been going on ?
Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled !
I know how Colombus felt
Finding another world
Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break ! For Heaven's sake !
How long has this been going on ?
Yes, I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years ?
Listen, you, tell me do
How long has this been going on ?
What a kick
What a buzz
Boy, you click as no one does
Hear me sweet, I repeat
How long has this been going on?
Dear, when in your arms I creep
That divine rendez-vous
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true !
Kiss me twice, then once more
That makes thrice, let's make it four !
What a break ! For Heaven's sake !
How long has this been going on ?
How long has this... been going ... on ?...
