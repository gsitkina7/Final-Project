Now ladies and gentlemen, we have a little novelty
Here for you here this evening
We'll have a little argument between the saxophone
And the trumpet, 'cause these cats just told me
They're going to get away!
And, uh, the little trumpet just said
It's going to do the same
Ain't that right little trumptet? Say 'Yes, sir!'
(Laughing) Oh, that little devil
But before we, uh, riff we're going to
Chirp a few for you this time
So get your chops together boys
While we (mug?) slightly, lightly and politely
Chinatown, my Chinatown
Where the lights are low
Oh, my Chinatown
(Scat singing)
Oh, you (raffer?), you!
(Scat singing)
Look out there saxopone
What's the matter with you? Let's go!
Look at them cats getting away
Looks like (their after me?), look at that you all
But I'm ready, I'm ready, so help me!
I'm ready, look out here!
