Within the circle of your arms
I love to dance the night away
Within the circle of your tender embrace
I find the place I wanna stay
When all the lights are turned down low
Except the love light in your eyes
I find the sight to see that means more to me
Than all the sights in paradise
Oh yes I've wandered far and wide
I guess I thought I'd make the rounds
But since your arms both meet inside
You could drive me outta bounds
'Cuz it's funnier the sound
My independence has no charm
So honey never set me free
Within the circle of those arms that I love
You got the whole wide world for me, yeah
(scatting)
Oh yes!
(scatting)
My independence has no charm
So honey never set me free
Within the circle of those arms that I love
You got the whole wide world for me, yes
You got the whole wide world for me
For me!
(for me)
