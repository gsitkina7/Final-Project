Cake walkers may come, cake walkers may go
But I wanna tell you 'bout a couple I know
High steppin' pair, Debonair
When it comes for bus'ness not a soul can compare
Here they come, look at 'em, demonstratin'
Goin' some, ain't they syncopatin'?
Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em down
Dancin' fools ain't they demonstratin'?
They're a class of their own
Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em
You may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em
Strut your stuff, they're the cake walkin' babies from home
Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home
Here they come, look at 'em, syncopatin'
Goin' some, ain't they demonstratin'?
Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em down
Dancin' fools ain't they syncopatin'2?
They're a class of their own
Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em
You may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em
Strut your stuff, they're the cake walkin' babies form home
Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home
