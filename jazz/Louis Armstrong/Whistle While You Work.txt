Whistle while you work
Put on that grin and start right in
To whistle loud and long
Just hum a merry tune
Just do your best
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song

When there's too much to do
Don't let it bother you
Forget your troubles
Try to be just like the cheerful chick-a-dee
And whistle while you work
Come on get smart
Tune up and start
To whistle while you work

Yes when there's too much to do
Don't let it bother you
Forget your troubles
Try to be just like that cheerful chick-a-dee
Whistle while you work
Come on get smart
Tune up and start
To whistle while you work
