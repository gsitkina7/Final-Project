Pretty Little Missy, give me little kissy, baby
Sweetie little missy, give me little kissy, please
Honey baby, so far, I can really go for you, dear
Looking very kissy, little missy, have no fear
Speedy up, speedy up, speedy up, speedy up, honey I can’t wait
Pucker up, pucker up, pucker up, pucker up, baby, don’t be late
So prissy little missy, give me little kissy, baby
Give me little kiss, I’ll be your lovin’ kissing beau
