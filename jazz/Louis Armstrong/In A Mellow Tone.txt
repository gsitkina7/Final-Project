In a mellow tone, feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone, I've got company
Everything's okay, the live-long day
With this mellow song, I can't go wrong
In a mellow tone, that's the way to live
If you mope and groan, something's gotta give
Just go your way and laugh and play
You know there's joy unknown in a mellow tone
In  a mellow tone that's the way to live
If you mope and groan, something's got to give
Just go your way and laugh and play
You know there's joy unknown in a mellow tone
Just go your way and laugh and play
You know there's joy unknown in a mellow tone
In a mellow tone
