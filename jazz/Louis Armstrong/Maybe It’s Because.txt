Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me
Touched my heart and went right through
Now I can't tell you why; I only know that I
Fell helplessly in love with you
Oh, maybe it's because the song we danced to
Told a story old and new
I can't figure out just why it came about
Or how I fell in love with you
I could say you're grand and therefore
I care for you so
But there is a why and wherefore
And I'd like to know
Now maybe it's because the star I wished on
Made a certain wish come true
Or it just could be that you were meant for me
And maybe I was meant, oh baby, meant for you
Oh, baby, or it just could be that you were meant for me
And, baby, I was meant for you
