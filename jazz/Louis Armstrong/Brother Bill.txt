Well me and brother Bill went a huntin' away up in the hills of Maine
The reason why we went up there we thought we'd catch some gain
And as we were a huntin' away in the middle of the night
We shot somethin' that looked like a grizzly bear the doggone thing turned white
Well I dropped that gun and away I run
My brother Bill says boy what's the matter with you
And he'd known like me he'd've ran some too
Well I'd ran so fast to say and they couldn't catch me all day
Away I'd run cross that field they couldn't catch me with an automobile
My brother Bill got so excited he commited shootin' at me
I heard those bullets sizzlin' all among those trees
I was runnin' so fast that night my feet wasn't touchin' the ground
I heard a little tailbird in the tree singing he's Alabamy bound
Well I'm goin' home I'm all alone
My brother Bill says boy what's the matter with you
And he'd known like me he'd've cut out too
Well I run so fast to say and they couldn't catch me all day
Away I run cross that field they couldn't catch me with an automobile
No they couldn't catch me with an automobile
