Hey baby, how about this dance?
Why? 'cause it takes two to do this dance! Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Lets do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love
You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or a nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
Ther's a lot of things that you can do alone!
But ...
Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Lets do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love
You can stare at the moon by yourself
Take a laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot, go to pot on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone!
But listen here...
Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Lets do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love
Ohh seeee...
