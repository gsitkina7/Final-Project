It was such a fine spring day
Down Lou'siana way
With fragrance divine
And such magnificent regalia
Oh, so fine
Azalea
Oh what a lovely sight
In red, pink and white
Can't help but believe
That nothing evil can assail you
So na√Øve
Azalea
You're at ease on the knees
Of the moss covered trees
Whose tops meet to make a high ceiling
In the church-like pomp
Of the cypress swamp
I've yet to get that same strange feeling
I've got to go back there
And find that blossom fair
I always dream of
'Cause with you who could be a failure?
My first love
Azalea
