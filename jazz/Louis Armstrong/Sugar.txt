Oh sugar, I call my baby my sugar
I never maybe my sugar
Because my sugar is so confectionery
Funny, she never asks for my money
All I can give her is honey
That she can get anytime
I'd make a million trips to her lips
If I was a bee
'Cause she's sweeter than
Any candy to me
She's granulated sugar
I never cheat on my sugar
'Cause I'm so sweet on my sugar
That sugar baby of mine
