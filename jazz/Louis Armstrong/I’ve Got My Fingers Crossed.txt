I've got my fingers crossed
Not that I'm superstitious
I'm afraid it's too good to be true
I've got my fingers crossed
No wonder I'm superstitious
I'm so gay, and the skies are much too blue
Don't want no trouble with Old Man Trouble
And that goes double
On account 'cause I'm in love, yeah
I've got my fingers crossed
This thrill is so delicious
I'm afraid it's too good to be true
