I live here, boy
Now, I don't dig you
Took you for my friend, thought you were my pal
But now I found out you're tryin' to jive my gal
All shut eyes ain't 'sleep and all goodbyes ain't gone
I'm help to myself; you're tryin' to do me wrong
Do you call that a buddy?
(No, no)
Could that be your buddy?
(No, no)
I'm gonna shoot my buddy
(Yeah, yeah)
He's just a dirty guy
(Shoot him in the foot, shoot him in the foot)
Treated you like a friend, what more could I do?
I had an idea I could trust in you
You ate up all my rice and my stew beef
And tried to help me cut off the home beneath
Do you call that a buddy?
(No, no)
Could that be your buddy?
(No, no)
I'm gonna kill my buddy
(Yeah, yeah)
He's just a dirty guy
(Yeah, terminate him, terminate him)
I wish you were dead and under the ground
'Cause a man like you just shouldn't be around
You's loathe as a temple and slick as grease
I'm gonna turn you over to the chief of police
Do you call that a buddy?
(No, no)
Could that be your buddy?
(No, no)
I'm gonna part with my buddy
(Yeah, yeah)
He's just a dirty guy
