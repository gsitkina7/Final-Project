I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothin's what it once used to be
And when the song birds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe this song
Once love was king
But king can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Mmm, never be the same
Since we're apart
But there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again
And when the song birds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe this song
Once love was king
But king can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Mmm, never be the same
Since we're apart
But there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again
