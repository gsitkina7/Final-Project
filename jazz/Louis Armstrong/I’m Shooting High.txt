I'm shooting high
Got my eye on a star in the sky
Shooting high
I'll never stop till I get to the top
Tell me why shooting high
You know it's you I'm after
You're my lucky star
I'm on a rainbow rafter
Climbing up to where you are
I'll have the time, it's a climb
But I'll make it 'cause I'm shooting high
Every morning when I raise my blind
To greet another day
I begin by making up my mind
That it's my lucky day
I'm shooting high
Got my eye on a star in the sky
Shooting high
I'll never stop till I get to the top
Tell me why shooting high
You know it's you I'm after
You're my lucky star
I'm on a rainbow rafter
Climbing up to where you are
I'll have the time, it's a climb
But I'll make it 'cause I'm shooting high
