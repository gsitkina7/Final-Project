Every time it rains, love, pennies from heaven, love
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down, babe
Hand them for a package of sunshine and flowers, love
Don't you know the things you love, they must have showers
And when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
