You're the apple of my eye
You're luscious and you're sweet
You're the apple of my eye
You're sweet enough to eat
Now since we met
I always get that certain feeling
And furthermore I love you
For you're so appealing
You're the apple of my eye
Your kisses are delish
They're tastier, yeah, than homemade apple pie
I'll hang around your orchid
Till I win your heart
'Cause you're the only apple
In my apple cart
I'm gonna shake your tree
Until you fall for me
'Cause you're the apple of my eye
Now look here Velma
You know, you're the apple of my eye too, baby
You're luscious and you're sweet
You're the apple of my eye
You're sweet enough to eat
Now since we met
I always get that certain feelin'
(Me too)
And furthermore I love you
For you're so appealing
(Sure)
You're the apple of my eye
You're kisses are delish
They're tastier than a homemade apple pie
Now dig this Velma
Now speakin' of your history or so they say
If I ate an apple
That'd keep that old doctor away
(You bad man)
Gonna shake your tree
Until you fall for me
'Cause you're the apple of my eye
(Hey pops, dig this)
You're the apple of my eye
Apple of my eye
When Adam ate that apple
Darlin', I believe
That this is just exactly
What he said to Eve
Well dig this, pops, I'm gonna shake your tree
(Yeah baby)
Gal, look like you're tryin' to fall for me
'Cause you're apple of my eye
