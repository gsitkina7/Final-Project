On my way now, got on my travelling shoes
On my way now, got on my travelling shoes
Well, I'm on my way now got on my travelling shoes
Them shoes now got on my travelling shoes
Oh, way child got on my travelling shoes
Well, I went to the church, I walked right in
The saints began to pray and the Lord came in
I went to the alter, didn't find a fault
The saints began to pray and the fires did halt
On my way now, got on my travelling shoes
Well, I'm on my way now got on my travelling shoes
Them shoes now got on my travelling shoes
Oh, way child got on my travelling shoes
Well, I went to the valley, didn't go to stay
My soul got empty and I stayed all day
I went to the river and walked right in
The saints were all saying, "wash away your sins?
On my way now, got on my travelling shoes
Well, I'm on my way now got on my travelling shoes
Them shoes now got on my travelling shoes
Oh, way child got on my travelling shoes
I'm on my way now got on my travelling shoes
On my way
Yes, I'm about to leave you on my way
I'm wearing my travelling shoes on my way
Yes, I'm going home where things are always good!!
