Old Deacon Splivin, his flock was givin' the way of livin' right, yes
Said he, "No wingin', no ragtime singin', tonight", yes
Up jumped Aunt Hagar and shouted out with all her might
All her might
She said, "Oh, tain't no use to preachin'
Oh, tain't no use to teachin', each modulation of syncopation
Just tells my feet to dance and I can't refuse
When I hear the melody they call the blues, those ever lovin' blues
Just hear Aunt Hagar's children harmonizin' to that old mournful tune
It's a-like choir from on high broke loose, amen
If the Devil brought it, the good Lord sent it right down to me
Let the congregation join while I sing those lovin' Aunt Hagar's blues
