It was short, but it was sweet
Nevertheless, maybe we'll meet
Some other place, some other day, some other time
Though it's sad I know it's true
You've gone away with somebody new
I played the game, I can't explain
It was short but so sweet
Yes
I tell no stories
Away from school
You may have been the teacher
But I was happy playing the fool
It was right, then it was wrong
Though our love didn't last very long
You'll always be honey to me
It was so short but it was so sweet
Yes
It was right, then it was wrong
Though our love didn't last very long
You'll always be honey to me
It was so short but it was so sweet
