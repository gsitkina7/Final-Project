When a fellow loves a maiden
And that maiden doesn't love him
It's the same as when a bald man
Finds a comb upon the highway
The cucaracha, the cucaracha
Doesn't want to travel on
Because she hasn't
Oh no, she hasn't
Marihuana for to smoke
All the maidens are of pure gold;
All the married girls are silver;
All the widows are of copper
And old women merely tin
My neighbor across the highway
Used to be called Doa Clara
And if she has not expired
Likely that's her name tomorrow
All the girls up at Las Vegas
Are most awful tall and skinny
But they're worse for plaintive pleading
Than the souls in Purgatory
All the girls here in the city
Don't know how to give you kisses
While the ones from Albuquerque
Stretch their necks to avoid misses
All the girls from Mexico
Are as pretty as a flower
And they talk so very sweetly
Fill your heart quite up with love
One thing makes me laugh most hearty
Pancho Villa with no shirt on
Now the Carranzistas beat it
Because Villa's men are coming
Fellow needs an automobile
If he undertakes the journey
To the place to which Zapata
Ordered the famous convention
