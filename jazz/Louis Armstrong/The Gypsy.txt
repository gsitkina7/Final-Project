In a quaint caravan
There's a lady, they call The Gypsy, yes
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears, yes, yes, yes
Everything will come right
If you only believe The Gypsy, yeah
She can tell at a glance
That your heart's full of tears
Yes, she looked in my hand and told me
My lover was always true
But even my heart, I know dear
Somebody else is kissing you, yes
But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe The Gypsy
Although I know she is lying
That my lover is true
And will come back to me some day
