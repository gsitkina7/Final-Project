Yes, up the lazy river where the old mill run
Up the lazy river with the noon day sun
Linging in the shade of a kind ole tree
And throw away your troubles, dream of, dream of me
Dream of, dream of me
Up the lazy river where the robin's song
Two bright lights as we stroll along
Blue skies up above and the one I love
Up the lazy river, how happy we will be, yeah
Yes, up the lazy river, yes
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
Up the lazy river, you river, oh, you river
Oh, you down river
