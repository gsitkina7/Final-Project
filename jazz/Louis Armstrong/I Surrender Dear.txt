We played the game of 'Stay away'
But it costs more than I can pay
Without you I can't make my way
I surrender dear
I may seem proud, I may act gay
Oh, but it's just a pose, I'm not that way
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender dear
Yes, little mean things we were doing, baby
Must have been part of the game
Lending spice to the wooing
Oh, but I don't care who's to blame, yes
When night appears, shadows fall
 mama, you'll hear my poor heart call
To you my love, my life, my love, my all
Oh, baby, I surrender dear
