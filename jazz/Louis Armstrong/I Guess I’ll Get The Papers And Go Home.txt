Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart
I get some consolation when I read
Of someone else's lonely heart, yes
I wonder if you get the papers too
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Until you in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home, yes
I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart, yes
I get some consolation when I read
Of someone else's lonely heart
I wonder if you get the papers too
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Baby, till you in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Babe, I guess I'll get the papers and go home
