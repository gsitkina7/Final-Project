In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die
I sit in my chair filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere, I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude I'm praying
Dear Lord above, send back my love
