I hear singing and there's no one there
I smell blossoms and the trees are bare
All day long I seem to walk on air
I wonder why, I wonder why
Now, I keep tossing in my sleep at night
And what's more, I've lost my appetite
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies
Are twinkling in my eyes, I wonder why
Pops, you don't need no analyzin' , man
No?
It is not so surprising
That you feel very strange but nice
Your heart goes pitter-patter
Pops, I know what's the matter
Because I've been there once or twice
Put your head on my shoulder
You need someone who's older
A rubdown with a velvet glove
There is nothing you can take
To relieve that pleasant ache
You're not sick, man, you're in love
I hear singing and there's no one there
(You don't need analyzin', it is not so surprising)
I smell blossoms and the trees are bare
(That you feel very strange but nice)
All day long, I seem to walk on air
(Your heart goes pitter-patter, pops, I know what's the matter)
I wonder why, I wonder why
(Because I've been there once or twice)
I keep tossing in my sleep at night
(Keep your head on my shoulder, you need some chick who's older)
(A rubdown with a velvet glove)
And what's more I've lost my appetite
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies
(There is nothin' you can take to relieve that groovy ache)
Are twinkling in my eyes, I wonder why
(You're not sick, pops, you're in love)
Whatcha mean I'm in love, honey?
Dig yourself, dig yourself down
(You heard me, you're not sick, man, you're in love)
I'm in love
