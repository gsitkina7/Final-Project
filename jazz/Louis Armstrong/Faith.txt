You gotta faith, faith brother
Faith, faith little sister
You as old as your  brother
You as young as your faith
Folks, cool and cash all habit
Folks, who say trash all habit

The folks who  hash all habit
Faith, faith brother
Faith, faith little sister
We can hope for some charity
As long as we got faith
Well now faith can give you wings to fly
True faith can make you fly so high
Yes faith can touch the sky
You can solve the riddle of it
If you got a little of it
Folks who lend cash all habit
Folks who save trash all habit
It's undeniable
That gamblers on theirs knees all have it
Faith, faith brothers
Don't ya know it's faith, faith sisters
We can hope for some charity
We can hope for some charity
We can hope for some charity
As long as we got faith
