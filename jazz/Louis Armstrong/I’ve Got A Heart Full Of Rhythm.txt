Got no shoes on my feet
Ain't got nothing to eat
But I've got a heart full of rhythm
Not a dime to my name
But I'm rich just the same
'Cause I've got a heart full of rhythm
When sky's look gray
And every thing's wrong
I'll find my way, mama, by singin' a song
Let the great think I'm small
I can laugh at them all
'Cause I've got a heart full of rhythm
