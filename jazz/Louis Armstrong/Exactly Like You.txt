I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue, yes
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you, yes
Now why should we spend money
On a show or two, babe
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you
Yes, you make me feel so grand, yes
I wanna hand the world to you
You seems to understand
Each foolish little dream I'm dreaming
I'm scheming
Now I know why mother
And she taught me to be true
She made me for someone
Exactly like you, sweet mama
