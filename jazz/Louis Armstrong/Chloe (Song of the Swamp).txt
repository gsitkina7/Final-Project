Chloe! Chloe!
Someone's calling, no reply
Nightshade's falling, hear him sigh
Chloe! Chloe!
Empty spaces meet his eyes
Empty arms outstretched, he's crying

Through the black of night
I've got to go where you are
If it's wrong or right
I've got to go where you are
I'll roll through the dismal swamplands
Searching for you
'Cause if you are there
Let me be there too

Through the smoke and flame
I've got to go where you are
For no place could be too far
Where you are
Ain't no chains can bind you
If you live, I'll find you
Love is calling me
I've got to go where you are

(Louie! Louie!) What's that?
(Louie!) Somebody called my name?
Is that you honey? (Louie!)
I believe that I hear love calling me
I've got to go where you are
