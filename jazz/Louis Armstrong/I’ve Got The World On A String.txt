I've got the world on a string
Sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rainbow
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love?
Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go
I've got the world on a string
Sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, mama, I'm in love
Oh, what a world, what a life
Baby, I'm in love, is it?
Looka here, lucky me, can't you see
Mama, I'm in love?
Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go, yes
What a world, what a, what a life
Baby, love
Oh, what a world baby
Oh, I'm in love, yeah man
