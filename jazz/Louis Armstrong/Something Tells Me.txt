Something tells me I'm falling in love
Something tells me you're sent from above
Not the stars or the man in the moon
Though I'm certain they set the stage and opened the curtain
Something tells me my waiting is through
I hope something is telling you too
Something whispers that we'll never part
Something tells me it's my heart
