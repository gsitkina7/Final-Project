Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you are goin', I'm goin' your way
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me
