Where there's sunshine
Oh , that's where you are
Where there's laughter
Then you can't be far
You're in my dreams every night
Oh , how I long to hold you tight , I need you
I'd follow you dear , from here to a star
Your lips are honey , but sweeter by far
From now 'til forever
I'll keep dreaming of
You and the sunshine of love
