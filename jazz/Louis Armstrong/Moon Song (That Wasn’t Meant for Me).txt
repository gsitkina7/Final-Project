It came from nowhere, the night that we met
It was like a melodious plea
Sweet moon song that wasn't meant for me
Why is it always reminding me
Of a love dream that never could be?
Sweet moon song that wasn't meant for me
It came gliding into my heart
Riding on a moonbeam from above
Sorrow and this and the whole world
Blended in a rhapsody of love
Then I heard her singing to somebody else
What I thought was my melody
Sweet moon song that wasn't meant for me
