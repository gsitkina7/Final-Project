Sometimes, I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Baby, lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
Melody my memory
And I am once again with you
When our love was new, oh babe
Each kiss an inspiration
That was long ago
Now my consolation is
In the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You were in my arms, baby babe
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise, where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain, oh babe
In my heart, it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
Mama, mmmm, love's refrain
