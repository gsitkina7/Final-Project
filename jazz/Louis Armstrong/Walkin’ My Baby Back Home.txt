Now gee but it's great after bein' out late
Walkin' my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm
Walkin' my baby back home
We go 'long harmonizing a song
Or I'm reciting a poem
Owls go by they give me the eye
Walkin' my baby back home
Now we stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And snuggles her head on my chest, baby
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum powder all over my vest
And after I kinda straighten my tie
She borrows my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home
