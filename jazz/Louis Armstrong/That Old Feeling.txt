Oh, I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
Why, the moment that you passed by I got a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still
And once again, I seem to get that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart
Yes, I saw you last night, Fats, yeah
And got that old feeling, oh, you did, heh heh
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling, ah, heh
From the moment that you passed by
I didn't pass, I stopped, I got a thrill
You did, hey, hey and when you caught my eye
My little heart stood still
And once again, I seem to get that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart
