Without my walking stick, I'd go insane
I can't look my best, I feel undressed without my cane
Must have my walking stick 'cause it may rain
When it pours, can't be outdoors without my cane
If I ever left my house without my walking stick
Well, it would be something I could never explain
Oh, the thing that makes me click on lover's lane
Would go for naught if I were caught without my cane
Be, bop, bop, de, la, dum, be, bop, a, da, bum
Re, bop, be, a, rop, a, de, bop
Rump, a, de, dum, ra, da, da, de
Re, bop, bop, la, da, dum, re, bop, be, de, a
Rop, a, de, bum, rop, a, de, bum
Deet, de, de, a, ra, da, da, dum
If I ever left my house without my walking stick
Well, it would be something I could never explain
Oh, the thing that makes me click on lovers lane
Would go for naught if I were caught without my cane
