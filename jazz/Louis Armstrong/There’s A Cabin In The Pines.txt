There's a cabin in the pines, hidden in the wild wood
Wrapped in honeysuckle vines
Where a mellow moon is always shining
Shining on my cabin in the pines
There's a sweetheart in the pines writing me a letter
I can read between the lines
I can see she longs for my returning
To my little cabin in the pines
Whispering breeze, whisper to my love
Tell her I'll come back some day
Say that I'm blue, broken-hearted too
Sorry that I went away
There's a cabin in the pines meant to be a love nest
Down among the Carolines
Is it any wonder I'm so lonely
Longing for my cabin in the pines?
