I’ve just found joy
I’m as happy as a baby boy
With another brand new choo-choo toy
When I’m with my sweet Lorraine
A pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer skies
When you see them you will realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine
I'm so happy when it's raining, I don’t miss the sun
For it’s in my sweetie’s smile
Just to think that I’m the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle, yes
Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can’t wait until that happy day
When I marry sweet Lorraine
Yes when it's raining, I don’t miss the sun
For it’s in my sweetie’s smile, baby
Just to think that I’m the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle
Yeah, each night I pray, yes
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can’t wait until the lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine, yes
When the lucky day, yeah
When I marry sweet Lorraine
