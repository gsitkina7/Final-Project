When I'm calling you
Will you answer too?
That means I offer my love to you to be my own
If you refuse me I will be blue and waiting all alone
But if when you hear my love call ringing clear
And I hear your answering echo so clear
Babe, then I will know our love will come true
You belong to me, I belong to you
You belong to me, I belong to you
