You don't add up to much
Ain't got that glamour touch
You're trifling, lazy, ain't worth a cigarette ash!
Look out there, mama, look out there!
You can't be too fast, watch it baby!
You're just my good for nothin'
My sweet hunk o' trash!
My my, how you sound!
You're very short on looks, (Hear hear hear!)
Dumb when it comes to books
Look out baby, watch it honey!
And you stay full of corn just like succotash!
What you want me to do in my idle moments?
You're just a good for nothin'
But my sweet hunk o' trash!
Let me get a word in there honey
You runnin' your mouth!
You said I've worried you for years
I'm just a barfly moochin' beers
While you sweat over a hot stove, slingin' hash
Worked my fingers right down to the elbows!
Yes, I may be good for nothin'
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash!
Forced to admit it, baby, forced to admit it!
You said I spread my love all around
And with the chicks all over town
But how can I when you keep me broke
So I can't spend no cash?
Yes, I may be good for nothin'
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash!
Listen here pops
You know you lie about your youth
I don't lie, baby
I'm just careless with the truth, that's all!
How careless can you be?
I don't know
With all young chicks you try to make a flash
Now baby, it ain't like that, no!
But you're still my good for nothin'
My sweet hunk o' trash!
Now when you stay out very late
It sure makes me mad to wait
How come baby?
Cause you come home too tired to raise just one eyelash!
Watch it baby, watch it!
You're just good for nothin'
But you're my sweet hunk o' trash!
Yes indeed!
