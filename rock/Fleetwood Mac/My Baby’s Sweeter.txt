My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She's so sweet to me

As sweet as honey
She make me feel like a bee
She walks like an angel
She got a ways like a child
A million dollar kiss and a billion dollar smile
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She's so sweet to me, yeah

I don’t need money, I don’t need gold
I need her love to satisfy my soul
With my babe I don’t need a thing
But a married life and a wedding ring

My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
You're so sweet to me
