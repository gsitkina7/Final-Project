Don't go, I'm askin' you to stay, don't go
Don't go, I'm askin' you to stay
Just a little while longer - you really don't have to go away
Please stay, now just because I told you to, please stay
Please stay, now just because I told you to
Just stay because you love me - I'll do anything for you
Yeah
Break: (12 bar)
Baby, this is more than I can bare, baby
Oh baby, this is more than I can bare
I give you lovin' any time - anyplace or anywhere
