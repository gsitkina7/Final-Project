If you be my baby
I tell you what I'll do
Give you so much loving
You just got to love me too

If you be my baby
Lord, if you be my baby
I'm the one who'll make you satisfied
Now listen to me, baby
What I'm talking about
Now you got something, woman
Makes a dumb man scream and shout

If you be my baby
Yeah, if you be my baby
If you be my baby
I'm the one who'll make you satisfied

Now I'm looking for a woman
That isn't never done no wrong
She'll cook my meals in the day time
And love me all night long

If you be my baby
Yes, if you be my baby
Lord, if you be my baby
I'm the one who'll make you satisfied
