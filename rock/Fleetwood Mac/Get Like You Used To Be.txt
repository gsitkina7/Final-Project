Oh, baby, you used to mean so much to me
Oh, baby, you used to mean so much to me
But you just think the same way
Get like you used to be

You're loving so many women, every one you see
You're loving too many women, every one you see
We never get much time together
Get like you used to be
There's no one in the world, no one else for me
There's no one in the world, no one else for me
But I think I'm gonna start looking, baby
So get like you use to be

Oh, love me but don't leave
Love me, baby, but don't you grieve me
Oh, baby, you used to mean so much to me
I wanna get my arms around you, baby
So get like you used to be
