Me and my baby don't do nothing but lay around all day long
I said, "Me and my baby don't do nothing but lay around all day long"
Yeah, when I'm with my baby, lazy poker going on

She puts some coal on the fire, so I can keep my poker hot
Yeah, we stoke around all day long
And night time we stoke around some more

Well now me and my baby don't do nothing, lay around all day long
I said, "Me and my baby don't do nothing but lay around the whole day long"
When I'm with my baby, lazy poker going on
Lazy poker
