I do come from miles away
Haven't got no place to stay
Glad to help you plow your fields

Farmer's daughter

Might be just a couple of days
Clean up rest and on my way
Thank you and I'm must obliged
Farmer's daughter
Ooh, ooh

So long better leave your land
Many thanks it was mighty grand
I do hope to see you again

Ooh, farmer's daughter
