Where are you darling?
When my Moon is rising
And your sun is shining down
What are you doing?
Are you missing me
The way that I'm missing you now?

The river goes on and on
And the sea that divides us
Is a temporary one
And the bridge will bring us back together
What are you doing?
Going down in to Soho
As I take my rest tonight
What are you doing?
Are you busy with your world?
Well I wish you were busy with mine
