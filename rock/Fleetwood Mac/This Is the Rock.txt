This is the rock
We've been talking about
Yeah this is the rock
Makes you jump and shout

This is the rock
That knocks you right out

It makes you lose
All your troubles and cares
You'll lose your blues
They isn't going nowhere

Well you can get back on the roof
And shout it all around
Get up on your seats about
What I'm putting down
Get them all a hoping to that crazy beat
Get up all a bopping and a tapping their feet

Because it's the rock
Moves you all day long
Yeah it's the rock
Getting everyone
This is the rock
That really turns you on

Whoo



Yeah this is the rock
That really turns you on
Whoa this is the rock
