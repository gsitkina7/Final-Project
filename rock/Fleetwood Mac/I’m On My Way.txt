I was a fool when I left you
I should have known
To find a good man was a hard thing to do
But temptation got the best of me

So there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I must have been blind to go away
And leave you behind
But can you find it in your heart to forgive me
And try one more time?
I want a chance to do things your way

So there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

I've had my little run out
And I know you I can't do without
But give me a chance and I'll be more to you
Than just a pair of hands
I'll do whatever, whatever
Whatever you want me to
Because I feel, yes, I feel
I owe that much to you

But there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way
If you let me come home, I'm on my way
If you let me come home, I'm on my way
If you let me come home, I'm on my way
