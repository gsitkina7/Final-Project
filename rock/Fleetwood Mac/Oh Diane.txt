Oh no here I go again
Falling in love again

Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slipping through your hands
Oh, oh, whoa

Whoa, oh, Diane
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)
Will I love you? I will, always
Will you stand by me? Always

Cause love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slipping through your hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, oh, Diane
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)

Talking 'bout Diane, mmm mmm
(Diane)
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)

1:38 - 1:51

Whoa, oh, Diane
Oh, whoa, oh, Diane
Ooo, (Diane)
Talking 'bout Diane, mmm-ooo
(Diane)
Whoa, oh, Diane
Oh-ohh, ooh
(Diane)
