No matter what goes wrong
You'll never be alone, baby
Just lay down beside me
And let your love hide me, oh baby

Seems that things
Don't mean a thing
When I
I mean nothing without you
And if you're ever feeling down
I'll come down and hang around you, baby
Because I hold the winning hand
Just to get to stand beside you baby


Oh I'm just going to do whatever
Keeps us together, oh baby
Because I love you more then love
And I put nothing above you, oh baby

And things they aren't going to mean a thing
And I mean, I mean nothing
No nothing without you

Oh I mean nothing without you
