Let me see the sign
I want to know the treasure you hide
Each and every night, I wonder about you
Love, open the door

Can’t you hear me cryin’?
I’m losing my mind
Can’t you hear me pleading?
Please hear me this time
Let yourself be mine
Let me see your little light shine
You know I want you to welcome me home
Love, open the door

Can’t you hear me cryin’?
I’m losing my mind
Can’t you hear me pleading?
Please hear me this time

Each and every night, I wonder about you
Love, open the door
Love, open the door
Love, open the door
