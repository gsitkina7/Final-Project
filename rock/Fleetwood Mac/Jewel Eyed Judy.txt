Moonshine time, thoughts of you
Spinning 'round as thoughts do
I just wondered if your eyes still shine
As they did when you were mine
I can see in a dream
Thoughts so clear and jewels that gleam
Would your eyes still sparkle then?
If we were, once again

Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Lovely Judy, can you see?
Where it is you're meant to be
Where you lay your head tonight
May the stars find your light
So am I, sitting here
Moonlight glistens on my tears
Is this all that we could find?
Chains of memories left behind

Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy, please come home
Jewel eyed Judy, don't leave me alone
