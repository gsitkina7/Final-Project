I'm so lonely and I'm so blue
Since you left me for somebody new
Don't you know I need you darling, I want your tender touch
I need you by my side, I want you so much
Well I need your tenderness
Don't you know that I want your sweet caress?
Don't you know I need you baby, want you here by my side
I want you near me, say you'll be my bride
Don't you know I'm so lonely and you know I'm so blue
Since you've gone I'm so sad and blue
Don't you know I need your tenderness?
Don't you know I want your sweet caress?
Don't you know I've been so lonely since you've been gone
Don't you know I miss your loving, don't you know you're the only one
