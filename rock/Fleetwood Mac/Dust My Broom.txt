I'm getting up soon in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm getting up soon in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best girl I'm loving
Now my friends can get in my room

I'm going to write a letter
Telephone every town I know
I'm going to write a letter
Telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi
She be in East Monroe I know
I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
No, I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
Man because no good darling
They shouldn't allow her on the street, yeah

I believe, I believe my time isn't long
I believe, I believe my time isn't long
I ain't goinna leave my baby
And break up my happy home
