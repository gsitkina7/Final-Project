I'll be coming home soon baby please be waiting outside your door
I'll be coming home soon baby please be waiting outside your door
When I get back with you baby you know I ain't going to leave any more
When I get on that train baby you'll know it won't be long
When I get on that train baby you'll know it won't be long
I'll give you all the love little darling I've had in store for you since I've been gone
I ain't going to leave no more little girl this time I'm coming home to stay
I ain't going to leave no more little girl this time I'm coming home to stay
I'm going to give you a no good mother every night and every day
