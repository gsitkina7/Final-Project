Well you thought you had a hold on me
But it's different now
Everything you done before
Fell upon you now

Are you just a bad loser?
But you never let go
(And you're going to go down)
Yes, you'll go down but you'll never let it show
All the strings and the strokes in the ocean
Won't buy you piece of mind
All because you did what you did
You're not the peaceful kind


I think you really know what I mean
But I'll tell you one more time
Oh, because it's the truth and you know it
That you're no friend of mine
