Oh, you're a dream
Hide your head in the sand

You're far away when I want you around
And leave me lonely when I'm feeling down
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?
Why is it, baby, our love just won't grow?
You made me happy, but time has gone by
Please leave me softly, I won't say goodbye
So all I wanted slips through my hands

You're far away when I want you around
And leave me lonely when I'm feeling down
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?
Do you ever wonder or worry about me?
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me?
