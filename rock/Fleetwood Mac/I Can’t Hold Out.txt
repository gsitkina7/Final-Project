Oh!

I just talked to my baby on the telephone
She said, "stop what you're doing and come on home"

I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone
She said, "Daddy, you know I love you, you're my desire"
I love you, baby, I hate to see you cry

I can't hold out
I can't hold out to long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone


She said, "Daddy you can run, walk, or fly"
I love you, baby, and you're my one desire

I can't hold out
I can't hold out to long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

Woah, talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone


Yes, you, talk to me, baby
Oh, talk to me, baby
Talk to me


Talk to me, baby!
