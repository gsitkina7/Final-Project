I love the purple dancer
Dancing in the space of... time
She can surely know the answer Standing in the steps of... mine Will I need her
Will I wonder
Will I fall down to the ground
Is it love that is the answer
Will she lift me to the sound Must I stay a minute longer
Eyes bewitching me does more
Tries to keep me from my wonder
Knowing her, now I must go Will I need her
Will I wonder
Will I fall down to the ground
Is it love that is the answer
Will she lift me to the sound I love the purple dancer
Dancing in the space of... time
She can surely know the answer
Standing in the steps of... mine Will I need her
Will I wonder
Will I fall down to the ground
Is it love that is the answer
Will she lift me to the sound I won't stay a minute longer
Eyes bewitching me does more
Tries to keep me from my wonder
Knowing her, now I must go
