I've got a mind of my own
Why don't you think the same as me I used to talk to other people
They just put me in misery
Now the same thing happens, when
Nobody talks to you…
You sit around for hours and you
Don't know what to do…"
So tell me, why don't you think the same as me
I used to talk to other people
They just put me in misery
Break
I've got a mind of my own
I've got a mind of my own
I've got a mind of my own
I've got a mind of my own
Yes, I've got a mind of my own, baby
Why don't you think the same as me
