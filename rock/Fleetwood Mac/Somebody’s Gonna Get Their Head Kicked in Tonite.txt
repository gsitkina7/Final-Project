Oh well, the band is rockin', everybody's feelin' alright alright
It's a Wednesday night, there sure is gonna be a fight
Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
Well the joint is jumpin', everybody's shoutin' for more
Well there's gonna be a pool of blood on the dance hall floor
'Cause somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
We're gonna rip up the chairs and tear down the walls
Smash up the band and really have a ball
Will be everybody in a physical rage
And the whole dance hall will be a doggone mess
Oh Well now the band is rockin' and everybody's feelin' alright
It's a Wednesday night, there sure is gonna be a fight
'Cause somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
We're gonna rip up the chairs, tear down the walls
Smash up the band and really have a ball
Will be everybody in a physical rage
And the whole dance hall will be a doggone mess
Oh well now the band is rockin', everybody's shoutin' for more
Well there's gonna be a pool of blood on the dance hall floor
Oh yeah
Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
