Everytime that you make me smile
It's the same old way it used to be
And that's enough for me

Everytime that sleep don't come
It's the same old pain that used to be
And that's enough for me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm, ah, oh 
Everytime that sleep won't come
It's the same old way it used to be
And that's enough for me
