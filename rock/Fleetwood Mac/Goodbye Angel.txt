Goodbye Angel
I'm going down
But I'm not going 'round the bend
I'm giving out
But I'm not giving in
Love turned to hate
Touch turned to pull
What could I do?
My cup was full
Goodbye angel
Goodbye Angel
I'm giving out
But I'm not giving in
'Cause yesterday is not like today my friend
Love turned to hate
Touch turned to pull
What could I do?
My cup was full
Goodbye angel
Goodbye angel
Just let it go...
Keeping on pulling...
Just let it go...
Goodbye angel
Keeping on pulling...
Just let it go...
