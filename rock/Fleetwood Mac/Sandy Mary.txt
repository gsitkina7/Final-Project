There's a girl I love, Sandy Mary is her name
There's a girl I love, Sandy Mary is her name
She got those bony bare looks
Enough to drive a vegetarian insane
She do not read so well, made the teacher go back to school
Do not read so well, make the teacher go back to school
A bony bare baby, yes, and I'm her bony bare fool
When we're lovin' - Sandy Mary
Get so high - feel so ready
Hold me baby - hold me darling
Feel my love come, to you fallin'
Hold me baby - hold me darling
Hold me baby - hold me darling
Feel my love come to you fallin', now
Sandy Mary, Sandy Mary -
Now, baby, you're the one for me, yeah
Sandy Mary, Sandy Mary -
Now, baby, you're the one for me
You got just what it takes
To make a flesh-eater out of me, yeah
