Come in this house
Stop all of that yakety yak
Come in this house, woman
Stop all of your yakety yak
A stop your yacking woman
You're nothing but an alley cat

You talk all day
You talk about this and that
You talk all day, woman
You're talking 'bout this and that
Don't make me nervous
I'm holding a baseball bat
A honey hush, you're talking too much
A honey hush, you're talking too much
I'm gonna love you honey
I'm taking no more of this stuff

Well a-hi ho, a-hi ho Silver
Hi-yo, a-hi-yo Silver
Hi-yo, a-hi-yo Silver
Hi-yo, a-hi-yo Silver
Hi-yo, hi-yo Silver away


Keep on in here
Talkin' 'bout this and that
You talk all day there, woman
Talkin' 'bout this and that
Don't make me nervous
I'm holding a baseball bat

A honey hush, you're talking to me
Honey honey honey honey hush, you're talking to me
Stop your yackin'
I'm taking no more of this stuff
Whoa hi ho-a-hi ho Silver
Hi-ho, a-hi-ho Silver
Hi-ho, a-hi-ho Silver
Hi-ho, a-hi ho Silver
Hi-yo Silver, Silver away
