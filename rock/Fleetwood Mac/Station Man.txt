Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?

Midnight train now is leaving
Engines screaming
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Where I'm going, I don't know
But you tell me I must go
When we're leaving, I don't know
But you tell me now
I see it's coming and bringing something
This train of loving
I see it's coming, I hear it's running
This train of loving from ages past
Station Man, I've been waiting
Can you tell me when we're leaving?
