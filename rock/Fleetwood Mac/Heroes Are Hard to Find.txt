Girls, you know when you're in the mood (In the mood)
You may meet a man can't do anything good (Nothing good)
But you've got to pity him and try to understand (Understand)
That a hero, a hero is so hard to find

When he takes you for his love (For his love)
And he tries to tell you, there isn't any other (Don't believe him)
Oh, he may kiss you and tell you he'll miss you (Such a shame)
But don't forget, a hero is so hard to find
When he says "hello," don't forget they're all the same
(You know they're all the same)
You may end up sitting all alone and with yourself to blame
Oh, don't you let him


(Heroes are)
So when he tells you you've got diamonds in your eyes
(He's just lying)
Don't get carried away because you know he's selling you lies
(He's just lying)
So when you get the feeling the man you've got's no good
(He's no good)
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find

Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
Heroes, heroes are hard to find
