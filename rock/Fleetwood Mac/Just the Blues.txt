I wake up every morning
People and take a look at the rising sun
I wake up every morning
And take a look at the rising sun
Then I realize my babe's gone
I missed her last night from holding her in my arm
I'm gonner ring up Turner
And I try to see if the little girl is over there
I'm gonner ring up Turner
And I try to see if the little girl is over there
Well I know, I know my baby
I know my sweet thing by the cloth she wear
She got great big sexy legs
And she wear the shoe number three
She got great big sexy legs
And she wear the shoe number three
I got to find, I got to find my sweet thing
Because her love means everything in this world to me
Since she been gone
You know my life don't seem the same
Since she's been gone
I tell you my life don't seem the same
People you know it fills my heart with sorrow
Every time I hear another man calling my woman's name
