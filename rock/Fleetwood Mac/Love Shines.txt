You've got a sweet heart
Never will you be replaced
And it's so hard
The memory can't be erased

Love shines when I think of you
You make it happen, you make it true
Love shines there can be no doubt
What this feeling is all about
Oh, baby your love shines
Love shines so bright, so bright
Oh, did you know your
Love shines, love shines so bright

On and on it will always be
Rhythm, rhyme and harmony
Yeah, baby your love shines
Love shines tonight, tonight

You cast a spell
A magical revelation
And I see so well
My ultimate destination




After all the reckoning
After all the promises
All the darkness in my heart
Has gone away, gone away
So on and on it will always be
Rhythm, rhyme and harmony
Yes, baby your love shines
Love shines tonight

Oh, don't you know your
Love shines, love shines so bright
Oh, baby your love shines
Love shines so bright
