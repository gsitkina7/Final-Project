Tell me anybody
Do you really give a damn for me?
Tell me everybody
Do you give a damn, do you really give a damn for me?
'Cause I just wanna tell you
'Bout some things been botherin' me
Now I was a ramblin' boy
I would rove from town to town
Now I was a ramblin' boy
I would rove, I would rove, I would rove from town to town
Lookin' for a sweet woman
Enough to make my love come down
If I needed anybody
Baby, I would take you home with me
If I needed anybody
Baby, I would take
Baby I would take, baby I would take you home with me
But I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody but me
And your sittin' there so green
Believe me, man, I'm just the same as you
And your sittin' there so green
Believe me, man, I'm just the same as you
You want me to make a last cry and be satisfied
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do
