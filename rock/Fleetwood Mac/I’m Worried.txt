I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried 'bout my baby
She goin' away from me

Well, I'm worried 'bout my baby
And I wonder where she gone
I'm worried 'bout my baby
And I wonder why she gone
I hope someday my baby love will return

Well, I hope someday my baby love will return
I hope someday my baby love will return
If she don't come back to me, my whole life will go to ruin

I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried, worried as a man can be
I'm worried 'bout my baby
She goin' away from me
