I can't believe you wanna leave
When you know that it'll hurt me so
And on bending knees
I beg you please not to go
Take a vow of the love we had
And all the fun that we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that it'd drive me mad
My life, my heart
My love in your hands
And now you wanna leave me
You wanna leave me for another man
Take a vow of the love we had
And all the fun that we had
And now you wanna leave
Now, don't you know that would drive me mad
My heart, my love
My life is in your hands
And now you wanna leave me
You wanna leave me for another man
Take a vow of the love we had
And all the fun that we had
And now you wanna leave
Now, don't you know that would drive me mad
