Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
I said baby, don't you want a man like me?
I could give you so much loving
More than a woman ever seen

Now come on baby, now we can make some love tonight
I said baby, make some love tonight
Well be rolling out the blankets
I'm going to make you feel alright
Your rolling man, I've got all the love you need
I've got so much loving
More than you ever going to see

I said baby, now we can make some love tonight
Come on baby, make some love tonight
Well be rolling out the blankets
I'm going to make you feel alright

I'm your rolling man, got all the love you need
Your rolling man, got all the love you need
Got so much loving baby
More than a woman ever seen
