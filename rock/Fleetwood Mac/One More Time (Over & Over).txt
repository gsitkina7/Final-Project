Could you ever need me
And would you know how, yeah
Don't waste our time
Tell me now
All you have to do
Is speak out my name
And I would come running anyway
And I said
Could it be me
Could it really, really be
Over and over
Could it really, really be
Ohh, over and over
Ohh, I said
Could it be me
Could it really, really be
Over and over
Could it really, really be
Don't turn me away
And don't let me down, yeah
What can I do
To keep you around
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
