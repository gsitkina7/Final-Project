Well goodbye world
It's sad but true
Got a date with the hangman
I have to leave you
I shot my darling
Three times of more

The reason I'm going
Is blood on the floor
The nights are so lonely
The days are so long
I'm in the jailhouse
Because they say I've done wrong
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore


Well I came home one night
She were lying
With her legs around
Another mans bod
She saw me, stared laughing
But she cried, when she saw my gun
Goodbye world
I guess we must part
They're taking my life
Because I shot my sweetheart
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore
