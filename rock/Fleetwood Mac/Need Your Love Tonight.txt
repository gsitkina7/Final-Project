Oh baby, I'll buy you a diamond ring
If you let me love you darling
I'll give you almost anything

Well it's early in the morning
And my baby can't be found
Oh it's early in the morning
And my baby can't be found
I'm looking for my baby
But she isn't nowhere around
Oh baby, I need your love tonight
Oh baby, you know I need your love tonight
I want to make love to you darling
While the moon is shining bright, yeah

Well it's high up in the morning
And I'm looking for my babe
Yes I been standing in the morning
And I'm looking for my babe
If she don't come back to me
I'll put her six feet in her grave

I said, "Baby, I need your love tonight"
Oh baby, I need your love tonight
I want to make love to you baby
While the moon is shining bright
