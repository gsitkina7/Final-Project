What's the world coming to
What they say isn't true
You can't plant no seed
Where there's only greed
I can walk anywhere
I can walk anytime
But the lone highway
Is the only way
What's the world coming to what's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon what's the world coming to
Every night every day
In this house filled with shame
I can say I care
But there's no one there
There's no truth in my lies
There's no light in my eyes
And it's all I guess
That I'll ever miss
What's the world coming to what's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon what's the world coming to
I can jump right off fall right into the ocean
I can come right out mean just what I say
But if I don't call for a reservation
They'll just turn me down turn me inside out
I don't say what they want
I don't do what they say
So I'm on their list
So I'm gone I guess
What's the world coming to what's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon what's the world coming to
