After school today, you smiled and looked my way
I asked you out - the following night you said
"Gee, It'll be alright" oh-oh, Jenny Lee
I took you to a dance
Never thought I'd get the chance to hold you near
The way I do for you
To say your love is true oh-oh, Jenny Lee
Every night I dreamed about you
I just can't live without you
Needing you near - every day
Uh-oh, don't go away
If you do I'd cry, I would surely die
Nothing would be  the same for me
'Cause your the only one for me, uh-oh, Jenny Lee
