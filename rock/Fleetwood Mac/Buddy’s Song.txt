Blue blue days, and long black nights
Lonesome tears you're going to cry for me

And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

Think it over before you leave
I got the love, that kind you need
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

I'll rave on with the things you say
You say you're going to leave but that'll be the day
Maybe baby, you don't know
I left Peggy Sue a long time ago

She's the girl on my mind
Everyday through all the time
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me

I'll rave on with the things you say
You say you're going to leave but that'll be the day
Maybe baby, you don't know
I left Peggy Sue a long time ago

She's the girl on my mind
Everyday through all the time
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me
And little baby
You'd better start babyin' me
