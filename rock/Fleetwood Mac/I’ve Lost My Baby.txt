I'm waiting this morning
I'm waiting for my baby to come back home
You know she left me this morning
And I don't know where she gone

She said she wasn't going to leave me
She said she'd always stay by my side
She said she wasn't going to leave me
She said she'd always going to stay by my side
This time she mistreated me
I don't know how many times she lied

Well I love my baby
And I'll tell the world I do

But now I've lost my baby
I don't know what in the world I'm going to do, yeah
