For a little peace in any season
I'd give up anything but your love
I don't want to trade, just to be happy
That's only playing anyway
But if I dream about it, it makes me wonder
For every good thing, must you get bad
But I won't worry, cause if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm just gonna keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
For every crime, there's retribution
And every valley has a mountainside
No, I can't trade just to be happy
That's the kind of deal won't work out right
It ain't good to stare inside yourself too long
For every true thing, there's one more lie
But I won't worry cause if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm just gonna keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
Gonna keep on
It's no good to stare inside yourself too long
For every true thing, there's one more lie
But I won't worry cause if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm just gonna keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
Gonna keep on
