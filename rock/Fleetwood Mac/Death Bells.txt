Sound like I'm hearing moaning, death bell ringing all in my head
Sound like I can hear moaning, death bell ringing all in my head
Yeah I know that I was gonna leave on a chariot but I didn't know
What kind of chariot gonna take me away from here
I want you to remember every living people, every living people bound to die
I want you to remember every living people, every living people bound to die
Yeah you know when that chariot come at you, they'll break running, try to hide
You all know my mama told me, you know my papa told me too
You know my mama told me, oh papa told me too
He said you know one day son, that chariot, oh Lord, coming after you
Yeah you know the life I'm living, I've been living it for a many year
You know the life I'm living, I've been living it for a many year
I know the chariot was coming for me but I didn't know
What kind of chariot gonna take me away from here
