String-a-long, string-a-long, that's what I am
String-a-long, string-a-long, that's what I am
String-a-long - that's all I am is just your
String-a-long someone that you just seem to
Bring along, whenever you are all alone
And need some company you always turn to me
String-a-long - that's all I do is sort of
String-a-long you never seem to notice
I'm along although I hope and pray that
You will need me someday
All I ever do - is tag along with you
No matter where you chance to roam
I'm just satisfied - to be by your side
Here - there - near - far - I wanna be anywhere you are
Treat me wrong and maybe soon you'll lose your
String-a-long, someone may come and bring a
Love that's strong and wanna string-a-long with me

I'll find somebody new - won't treat me like you do
I'll find somebody new - won't treat me like you do
