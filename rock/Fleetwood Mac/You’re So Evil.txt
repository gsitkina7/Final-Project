I'm leavin' you
Leavin' you
I got the feelin'
I'm 'bout to go
'bout to go
Go down all that lonesome road
Down that lonesome road
Down that lonesome road
By myself
You're so evil
'cause you're so evil
That's why I'm leaving you alone
Leaving you alone
You got the devil in you, woman
You got a devil in you, woman
Someday it's gonna be the death of you
It's gonna be the death of you
I'm gonna get my .44
Get my .44
Shoot a few holes in you
Yes I'll put you six feet under
Put you six feet under
Put you six feet under the ground
Six feet under the ground
And woman I shed no tears
Woman, I shed no tears
I go away with a smile on my face
Go away with a smile on my face
You got what you're due woman
You got what you're due
I'd be glad I won't see you anymore
See you anymore
