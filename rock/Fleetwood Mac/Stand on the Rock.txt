My love is like a rock
Nothing moves it away from you
And I can't feel the shock
You won't break it up
No matter what you do

When it all comes down
Stand on the rock
When you come back around
Stand on the rock
Your love is like the sea
Waves crashing against my heart
Changing constantly
But you won't change the love
Too strong to fall apart


Sooner or later you'll see
Nothing's going to change this love in me
Stand on the rock, because it's all right
Stand on the rock

Oh, you play so rough (so rough)
But my love's too tough
Might as well give it up

Sooner or later I'll make you see
Nothing's going to change this love in me

Stand on the rock, stand on the rock
Stand on the rock, stand on the rock


Stand on the rock
