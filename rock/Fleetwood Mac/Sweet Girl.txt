And he says, what do you love to do?
Outside your world
Who spends time with you?
Whom do you love when you're not working?
Sweet girl
Where would you go
If you had the time?
Crossing some crazy state-line somewhere?
To whom do you cry?
People are unkind
Sweet girl
But I chose to dance across the stages of the world
Everyone said I'd never learn
And I still hear your words, well
I waited all my life for you
Sweet girl

I did try to come back and listen
You never knew it
I didn't wish it
And I did hear every answer of every question
It's all about protection
Still through the sunlighted days I wait
Track a ghost through the fog
The sun is burning me
And you come running out
In the wind with me
The ocean is your blanket


I watched you fly through the world
In a golden ball
Many are the cities that I never saw at all
Sometimes I feel like I was always on-call
Sometimes even I am allowed to fall
He says, come down here for a minute
Well, come down here for a minute
He says, come down here for a minute
Sweet girl
