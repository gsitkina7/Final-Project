I've been waitin'
For you to call
And I've been wonderin'
If I might fall
We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love
We should have never
Let it slip away
Let's drink a toast now
To the glory days
We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love
