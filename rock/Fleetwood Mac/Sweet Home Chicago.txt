Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago
Well, do you remember when the steel mill shut down
We had to go in the country, mama, 'cause you couldn't live in town
Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago
Well, do you remember baby back in 1934
You had the nerve to tell your daddy
That you didn't want him no more
Ride on - baby, don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago
Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago
