Teenage darling, please be true
Teenage darling, I love only you
Teenage darling, teenage darling you're my girl
You caught me in a world
Teenage darling, please say you'll be mine
Now and forever, until the end of time
Teenage darling, you're my girl
Teenage darling, I love you so
Teenage darling, don't ever go
Plead on my love and on my heart
I want you to promise that we will never part
Teenage darling, you're my queen
Teenage darling, you're just sweet sixteen
Teenage darling, you're the answer to all my dreams
