What can I say this time?
Which card shall I play?
The dream is not over
The dream is just away
And you will fly like some little wing
Straight back to the sun
The dream was never over
The dream has just begun
The dream has just begun
Fingers find the ivory keys
And a song begins to begin
Like a wolf on the run
And you will find while in the wind
Something that you lost
The dream was never over, no
The dream was only lost
(Hours and hours of waiting for you, so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(And hours of waiting for you in hopes of meeting)
The dream has just begun
(Hours and hours of waiting for you, so strong and so fleeting)
(This way)
Well, the dream has just begun

She remembers how good it can be (Hours and hours of)
He remembers a melody (Waiting for you)
Ah, in the shadow of my shadow
In a gleam
He remembers how good it can be (Hours and hours of)
She remembers a melody (Waiting for you)
Well, in the shadow of my shadow
In a gleam, whoa
(Hours and hours of waiting for you, so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(Hours and hours of waiting this way, meeting me)
The dream has just begin
(Meeting this way)
(Hours and hours of waiting)
Straight back
Straight back
He remembers a melody
He remembers how good it can be
Straight back
Straight back
Straight back
