I had another dream about you last night
Sailing on a sea of blue
You were grieving for someone else
I was grieving for you

Miss fantasy
It may be you don’t remember me
But I remember you
In between the shadow and the song
In between the black and blue
From the window I heard your voice
Telling me you were through


Miss fantasy
I can see you don’t remember me
But I remember you

Do you still tremble when I fall?
Will you still answer when I call?
Would you still love to lean her up against a wall?
Everyone whispers when you go
Into the silence of down below
Ten thousand voices cry, on with the show

Everybody’s singing shine your light
Everybody knows it’s true
But you’re not the queen of the underground
Never leaving a clue

Miss fantasy
I can see you don’t remember be
But I remember you
I remember you
