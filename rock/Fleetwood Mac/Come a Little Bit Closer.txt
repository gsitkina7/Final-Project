I'm dancing to the music
Of a simple melody
And I wonder are you thinking
Of a single memory
And I know when I see them swaying
I can hear myself say

Come a little bit closer
(Come a little bit closer)
Because I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(Come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
Everything good, everything gold
Now all that's left is a sweet memory
If you love me, let me know
Why don't you show me which way to go?
Please don't leave me all alone
Because I can't make it on my own
And I know when I see them swaying
I can hear myself say

Come a little bit closer
(Come a little bit closer)
Because I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(Come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
I'll make you wrong, but that's where I belong
Why are you just a sweet memory?

Come a little bit closer
(Come a little bit closer)
Because I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(Come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
Everything good, everything gold
Why are you just a sweet memory?
Come a little bit closer
Come a little closer
