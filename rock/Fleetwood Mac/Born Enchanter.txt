Well, I'm a born enchanter
That's what the ladies see
Yes, I'm a born enchanter
Down in the city of dreams

Lord, do right by me
And let me go
Down in my city of dreams
Where I need to go
Well I'm a born enchanter, well
Well, I'm a born enchanter
Following the sabbath cross
Oh, I'm a born enchanter
Looking for the faith I lost

Lord, do right by me
And let me go
Down in my city of dreams
Where I need to go
Yeah, because I'm a born enchanter
