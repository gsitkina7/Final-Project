The sun is shining
But it's raining in my heart
The sun is shining
Although it's raining in my heart
I'm in love with my baby
And I hate to see us part
My baby left me this morning
I didn't even say goodbye
My baby left me this morning
No, she didn't even say goodbye
You know I love you baby
And I don't know the reason why
I had a dream
I had a dream one rainy night
I had a dream
I had a dream one rainy night
You know I'm looking for my baby
And you know the sun was shining bright
