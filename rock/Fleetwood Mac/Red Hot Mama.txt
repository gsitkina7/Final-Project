I got a fine little mama
She really's on the ball
I got a fine little mama
She really's on the ball
She is a red hot mama
And she ain't but five feet tall
She's got perfect hips and long black wavy hair
She's got perfect hips and long black wavy hair
Well, she knew that ain't a joke
And in town she ain't no square
She is a red hot mama
But she sure can put me down
Yes, she is a red hot mama
But she sure can put me down
When she start the lovin'
My love come tumblin' down
Shе's my red hot mama, she's my red hot mama
Shе's my red hot mama, she's my red hot mama
Well, when she started to love
My love come tumblin' down
Yes! She's my red hot mama, she's my red hot mama
She's my red hot mama, woah, she's my red hot mama
When she started to love
My love come tumblin' down
