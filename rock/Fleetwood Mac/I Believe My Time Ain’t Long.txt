(Care to dance, goes too far)
(I Believe My Time Ain't Long, take one)
(Shhh, tell her to shut up)
One, two, three, four

I'm gonna get up in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gonna get up in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best gal I'm lovin'
Now, my friends can get my room
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
And if I don't find her West Illinois
She'll be in East Monroe, I know

I don't want no woman
Want ev'ry downtown man she meet
No, I don't want no woman
Want ev'ry downtown man she meet
She's a no good li'l doney
She'd not allowed out on the street, mm-hmm, now


I believe
I believe my time ain't long
I believe
I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
And break up my happy home, mm-hmm
