Aah, aah

I want to be inside your heart
That's the place, the place for me
But I could understand, it won't be easy

You've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
Like I say it isn't easy to let your heart run wild
So if you want to please me, baby then don't act like a child
But I can understand, it won' t be easy

And you've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me

It doesn't matter if you're far away
Or right here by my side
That's the way I feel about it
We can't let the whole thing slide

Aah, aah

So if you can't see me right where you are
They why don't you send for me, baby by the nearest star
It won't be easy, and you've got to prove


Aah, aah
