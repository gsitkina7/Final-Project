Now when I saw you this morning
Tell me, why did you walk away?
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me, why did you walk away?
Can't believe that you don't love me
I thought our love was here to stay
Well, buzz me baby
I'll be waiting for you when you call
Buzz me, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
And if you forgot my number
Come on over and don't call at all
I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
Say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby
I'm like a ship that's lost at sea
If I ever get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973
Buzz me, baby
I said buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
If you forgot my number
Come on over and you don't even have to call at all
