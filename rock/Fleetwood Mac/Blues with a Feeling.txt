Blues with a feeling
That's all I've got today
Blues with a feeling
That's all I've got today
I'm gonna find my baby
If it takes me all night and day
What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
When the one you love
Has run off with somebody new
What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
What a lonesome feeling
When you're sad and blue
When the one you love
Has run off with somebody new
