Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just want to be back where I belong

World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night

World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

Umm turning
Everybody's got me down
World turning
Everybody's got me down
