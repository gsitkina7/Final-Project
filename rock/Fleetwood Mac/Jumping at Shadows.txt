What can you say? There isn't much to tell
I'm going down hill and i blame myself I've been
Jumping at Shadows
Thinking about my life
Everybody points their hand at me
I know I'm just a picture
Of what I should have been I've been
Jumping at Shadows Just thinking
About my life
God have mercy I think I'm going insane
The Devil's been gettin' at me
He's got me down again Got me
Jumping at Shadows Just thinking
About my life
