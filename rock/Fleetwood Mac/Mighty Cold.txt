Well, every time I wanna kiss you, it's a I don't know
And every time I wanna hold you, it's a let me go
Well, I'm buzzin' in the circus like a bumble bee
You got me swingin' in the breeze like a monkey in the tree
Goin' mighty cold, I try to warm, warm up
Well, every time I wanna hold you, it's a let me go
Hey, you know what's there to leave me standin' alone, uh uh
Well, I'm buzzin' in the circus like a bumble bee
You got me swingin' in the breeze like a monkey in the tree
Goin' mighty cold, I try to warm, warm up
Well, I'm seein' spots before my eyes
Lighten up like the fire flies
There ain't nothin' that I can do
Until you tell me, baby I need you
Well, don't you think you ought to love me, it's about time
Well, all I want to hear you say is that you're mine
Well you got me mixed up like crushed down fuzz
You treat me like a dog that you're tryin' to muzzle
Goin' mighty cold, I try to warm, warm up
Well, I'm seein' spots before my eyes
Lighten up like the fire flies
There ain't nothin' that I can do
Oh, until you tell me, baby I need you
Well, don't you think you ought to love me, it's about time
Well, all I want to hear you say is that you're mine
Well, I'm buzzin' in a circus like a bumble bee
You got me swingin' in the breeze like a monkey in the tree
Goin' mighty cold attemptin' to warm, warm up
You're mighty cold attemptin' to warm, warm up
You're mighty cold attemptin' to warm, warm up
