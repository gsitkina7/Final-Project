Have you ever wanted to steal a kiss?
Have you ever wanted to try?
But you let her get you scared to death
You got so mad you could cry?
Well, I'm a sorry for you but I really don't know why
'Cause you never know what your missing until you try
Have you ever wanted to hold her tight
But you just could work up the nerve
But you waited 'til she had to go
You got just what you deserve?
Well, I'm a sorry for you but I really don't know why, umm
'Cause you never know what your missing 'til you try
Well, you never know what you're missing, 'til you try, 'til you try
Well, you nеver know what you're missing, that's no lie, that's no liе
Well, you better listen to what I say
If you want her to kiss you tonight
Go ahead and hold her close to you
And squeeze her with all of your might
You better give her the word before she leaves you high and dry
'Cause you never know what your missing 'til you try, 'til you try
