I'm a man of action fire is my middle name
If you get burned little girl you are to blame
If you value your innocence stay out of my way
One touch of my power you'd be begging me to stay
'Cause I'm a man of action wild as the sea
Born for the blues born to be free
No, don't you get too close, so, don't you get too close
One touch of my power you could catch a dose
'Cause i'm a man of action no strings tie me down
No chick's attraction could make me stick around
So if you don't want to be burned don't give me no invitation
Until you have learned to live with desperation
Man of action, I'm a man of action
Man of action, man of action
Man of action, man of action
I'm a man of action
