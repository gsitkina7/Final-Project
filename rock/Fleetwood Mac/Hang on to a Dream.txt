What can I say - she's walking away - from what we've seen
What can I do - still lovin' you - it's all a dream
How can we hang on - to a dream
How can it ever be - the way it seems
How can we hang on - to a dream
What can I say - she's walking away - from how it was
What can I try - I still don't see why - she says what she does
How can we hang on - to a dream
How can it ever be - the way it seems
What can I say - she's walking away - from what we've seen
What can I do - still loving you - it's all a dream
How can we hang on - to a dream
How can it ever be - the way it seems
How can we hang on - to a dream
