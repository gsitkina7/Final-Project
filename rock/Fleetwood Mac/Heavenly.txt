Heavenly, heavenly
That's what you are, to me
A guiding light, in the night
For only me, to see
Your sweet lips, your lovely eyes
Hold the key to paradise
A guiding star, that's what you are
So heavenly, for only me
Is it your tender touch, I need you, oh so much
All the things you do, I'm so in love with you
Watch the way you smile, as we walk down the aisle
Heaven only knows what you mean to me
Heavenly, heavenly, that's what you are, to me
A guiding star, that's what you are
So heavenly, so heavenly
