Yeah, oh yeah, I just talked to my baby on the telephone
She said, "Stop what your doing, come on home"
I can't hold out, I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feelin', talkin' to you on the phone
She said, "Daddy, you know I love you and you're my desire"
You know I love you baby now, I had to see you cry
I can't hold out, I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feelin', talkin' to you on the phone, oh yeah
Oh yeah, she said, "Daddy you can run, walk or fly"
You know I love you baby, you're my own desire
I can't hold out, I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feelin', talkin' to you on the phone, oh yeah
Talk to me baby, talk to me baby, talk to me baby, talk to me baby
I get a real good feelin', talkin' to you on the phone, oh yeah
