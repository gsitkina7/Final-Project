Oh baby, please, baby please set a date
Baby, please, baby, please set a date
Don't you wait until tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow may be too late
When I get you in my arms
You know my heart gets full of proud
When I get you in my arms
You know my heart gets full of proud
When you whisper, "Daddy, daddy"
You know my love comes tumbling down
Well, I love you so much, baby
I love you better than I do myself
Well, I love you so much, baby
I love you better than I do myself
Well, if I can't have you, baby
I don't want nobody else
Oh baby, please, baby please set a date
Baby, please, baby, please set a date
Don't you wait until tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow may be too late
