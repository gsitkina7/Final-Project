Climb until you're getting high
Be a part of the scene like you're living your dream
Walk the room like you're on fire
Like your chasing the truth, gripping tight to your youth
(Holiest thing I know) (Holiest thing I know)
Gripping tight, gripping tight to your you-ou-ou-ou-outh
(Holiest thing I know) (Holiest thing I know)
Like you're cha-, like you're chasing the truth
But you're the holiest thing I know
Yes, you're the holiest thing, holiest thing I know
Look at the mess you've made
Babe, I'm not what you think
Come on, listen to me
Now all I do is feel afraid
Can't you see that I'm here
Can't you see I've been played
(Holy) (Holiest thing I know)
Then I'm dest-, then I'm destined to flame

But you're the holiest thing I know
Yes, you're the holiest thing, holiest thing I know
(Holiest)
(Holiest)
(Hol-holiest)
(Holiest thing I know)
(Holiest)
(Holiest)
(Hol-holiest)
(Holiest thing I know)
(Holy)
(Holiest)
(Hol-holiest)
(Holiest thing...)
Climb 'till you're getting high
Be a part of the scene like you're living your dream
Walk the room like you're on fire
Like you're chasing the truth, gripping tight to your youth

But you're the holiest thing I know
Yes, you're the holiest thing, holiest thing I know
