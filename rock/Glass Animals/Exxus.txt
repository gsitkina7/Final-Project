When you see him, look him in the eye
Look him in the eye, and he won't dare to follow
If you need to, hook him with your right
Hook him with your right till he wiggles and wallows

He sleeps atop a bag of raven's legs
Curled up rats napping by his head
Takes his eye out with a ball point pen
And makes nunchaku with his torn off legs
You wake up with a hatchet over your head
You wake up with a hatchet over your head

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone gone gone in the blink of my eye
I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone, gone, gone in the blink of my, blink of my

Open your eyes choking on his breath
Choking on his breath, you grimace then smile
Take a toke of his wet cigarette
He picks your brains, you stub it on his chest

Slit his tongue with one fast hand
Stuff his mouth with the salty sand
Tie his arms with hair from his head
And roll him 'round like a rusty can
You wake up with a hatchet over your head
You wake up with a hatchet over your head

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone gone gone in the blink of my eye
I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone gone gone in the blink of my, blink of my, blink of my
