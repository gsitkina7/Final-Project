Ooh

I break it, by God, your face
Awakened, two eyes, ballooning
Open sesame

Super silence in the quiet, eye inside the storm
Water from your broken iris fell toward the floor
Everything waiting, shakin' as it drops
I tried for you and I, for too hard, for too long
Gave it all and everything for more time, but I lost
Ooh, we're breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

Ooh

Ooh, I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

Two hearts foldin'
Pulling everything

Ooh, I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

Ooh, I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
It's all so incredibly loud
It's all so incredibly loud
