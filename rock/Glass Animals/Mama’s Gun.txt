In the summer, took my gun
And made him go to Neverland
He was something, my old husband
He had all you'd ever want
Did you say something? What'd you say?
Was that your voice or was that me?
Little voices buzzing poison
Backward noise from everything
Dr. Swango says I'm psycho
Says they all from Neverland
They'll never ever let me be
Was that your voice or was that me?

Dirty Dustin, said he saw him
Playing ball with Dizzy Jim
Dizzy Jim had never spoken
Whispered back, "You murdered him"
My heart strings broke and it was me
I pull, they stretch infinitely

In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing

Play with me, my love, in the summer sun
I'll be waiting in your favourite Cheshire grin
Lay with me, my dear, in the evening clear
I'll be dreaming in my paper-pale skin

In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, in the summer silence
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
