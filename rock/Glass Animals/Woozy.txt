Now can we place a bet
You love collect calls inside of your cigarettes
I still wonder why you can't seem to get it yet
If we go half then maybe we can spend another night, another day
Another chance for us to get right
Inside these walls we watch the tables turn
You say I should've had a mother and watch my navel yearn
There are things that I expect you know
How you gone plant a whole seed and not expect it to grow?
We just smoking too much weed, I'm still expecting to blow
Let's take a walk, don't forget your key, baby
Let's say a prayer, come on, get down on your knees, baby
Come on, get down on your knees, baby
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Don't get up, don't get up, don't get up, don't get up
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha

There's no doubt, you know I want this just as much as you
What if you lying? Then I'm just stuck here like a fucking fool
I'll still be stuck even if this is the fucking truth
You say I'm running from my problems, but there's no other way
If you decide to keep it, I don't know if I'mma stay
My shoulders dislocating, breaking under all this weight
I'm just thinkin bout your lateness, it's a bad time
I want to be situated before I have mine
Let's take a walk, don't forget your key, baby
Let's say a prayer, come on, get down on your knees, baby
Come on, get down on your knees, baby
Come on, get down on your knees, baby

Come on, get down on your knees, baby
(Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Don't get up, don't get up, don't get up, don't get up
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha, please, a-ha
Don't get up, don't get up, don't get up, don't get up)
