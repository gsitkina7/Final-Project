One young fawn, in a maze
Eager-eyed and the milky haze
Scampers round, heavy feet
Spinny legs and knobbly knees
Twitching tail and tongue-in-cheek
She munches fruit from harlot trees
Looking smug and fresh and pleased
She wanders so sloppily and eats

She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up, it makes her well up
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up, it makes her well up
She feels a lick, down her nape
It looks up with a fair glass face
The peeling palms of dirty hands
Jointed thumbs with drumstick ends
Yellow nails from pinching fags
A slimy creature lacking clad
He pulls his fingers from her mind
And lets her see, just like she was blind!

She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up, it makes her well up
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and sheâ€™s icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It make her well up, it makes her well up
