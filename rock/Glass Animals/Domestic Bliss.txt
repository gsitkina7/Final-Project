I see the bruise, I see the truth
I see what he been doin' to you
Blood on the shoes, what's his excuse?
He says he's doing some new kung fu
You always use his bullshit excuse
But I see what he been doin' to you

Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why'd you go back for that kiss?
Maybe it tastes like him when you've got tears on your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why don't we pack and leave this?
Why do you smile when he cries?
Why do you cry when he wins?
Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees, go to Hawaii
Fight for me, say, "We can leave," I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii

He got balloons, new flowers, too
Last one's dyin' in your bedroom
He squeezin' you, blame-blamin' you
Mama just usin' her red perfume
Domestic bliss
I know how bad you wanted it

Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why'd you go back for that kiss?
Maybe it tastes like him when you've got tears on your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why don't we pack and leave this?
Why do you smile when he cries?
Why do you cry when he wins?

Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees, go to Hawaii
Fight for me, say, "We can leave," I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii
My God, I'll be right in, the trickle of lightnin'
I knew before I heard, I felt it in my skin
My God, I'll be right in, the trickle of lightnin'
I knew before I heard, I felt it in my skin

Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees, go to Hawaii
Fight for me, say, "We can leave," I'm beggin', please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii
