Drip, drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So, so, so unusual
You taste like surfing videos

I'm going to read your mind
Big dicks and big ol' titties on the sly
Say I got Aries eyes
Fuck no, I'm a bonafide Aquemini
Ooh, who are you hiding?
White Russians and dirty diamonds
You fake your shyness
I just wish that I could see through you
Cheap booze, Pepsi blue
You got bottles in from 2002
Hot glue, vape juice
Hit undo, how the hell are you so cool?

Drip, drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So, so, so unusual
You taste like surfing videos

It's chemical warfare
Red lips and television eyewear
Raspberry soda hair
In the pool in a blow-up gummy bear

Fake youth, Scooby-Doo
Push Pops on the corner of the roof
Froot Loops, superfood
Chat shit but where's the real you?
Never seen The Price Is Right
I'm a liar, I've been on that shit since '99
You make me like a clown
Clap, clap, you're a clever-clever cookie now
Waterfalls coming out your mouth
What the hell are we doing now?
Waterfalls tearing you apart
What the hell are we doing now?
