I wanna make it right
I wanna make you cry

I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
Oh
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck

I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
Oh
