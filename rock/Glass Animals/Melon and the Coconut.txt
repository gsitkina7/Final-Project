Melon and the coconut are sittin' on the floor
Coco said to Melly, "I can't do this anymore
Everything we're doin' just feels fuckin' cold
Everything we're shootin', that's just fake B-roll
B-sides, killing time, filler, that's all
How did things happen when we were so close?
How did this all go so Pete Tong?
When it all started, I thought we would grow old
Living in the city with a baby and a dog
Doing school runs in a four by four
I make pancakes and waffles
I could be a stay at home G.I. Joe"

Melly said to Coco, "You can't do this anymore
One day, you'll see you're fuckin' wrong
Sometimes B-sides are the best songs
Sometimes killing time's very fruitful
I know I can't make you younger
I can't stop life movin' onwards
I can't hide you from life's horrors
I'm not makin' you like your father
Too much quinoa and online shopping
Off-White Air Force Ones in boxes
You're a fucking coconut, can't even put 'em on
Even if you could, you couldn't even pull 'em off"
