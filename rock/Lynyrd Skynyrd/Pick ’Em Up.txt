Ooooooooo.... Yeah OOOOOOOOO

Well sometimes I lose my direction, And sometimes I jump off track
But when I ride out baby, I can always get back
I need to feel the cool breeze in my face, The rumble of the engines between my legs
Hey little sister, You can color me gone
So if I want to stay out all night long, You can't stop me from running wild
Yeah don't worry how long I'm gone, I'll come back every once and a while
I pick them up, I lay them all down
I never like my feet, to ever hit the ground
Don't miss me when I'm gone, because I'll be around
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up and lay me on down
That's right. Wooo

Well I know I got a good life, Jim Beam, And women, They treat me right
I make my own rules, Like it or not
Now don't misunderstand me baby, I give it every once and a while
Well it's tough love honey, But I'll leave you with a smile
So if I want to stay out all night long, You can't stop me from running wild
Now don't worry how long I'm gone, I'll come back every once and a while


I've been here, I've been there, I've been everywhere
I wouldn't tell you no lies
And just like me you're a wild one, Won't you take me for a ride


You got to lay me on down, Yes you do
I'm a free spirit, Oh you know you are Johnny
Oooooooh That's what I am Oooooooh
