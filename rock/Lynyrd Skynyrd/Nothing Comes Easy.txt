Oh another hot cup of coffee – I’m up at 5 am
These old worn out working boots look like these beat up hands
But I get up and I do it – because people depend on me
Trying to keep my faith in this American Dream
Paychecks going down
Prices are going up
Takes most of my money just to fill my pick-up truck

Nothing Comes Easy – trying to feed my family
Nothing Comes Easy – for a working class like me
I’ve been doing time on the line – listen you don’t understand
Nothing comes easy
Nothing comes easy
Let’s put back the pieces to this broken promised land
All this crazy spending – I don’t understand
Politicians preaching – but it don’t never change
Same ol’ lines and bullshit – might as well flush it all down the drain
Nobody wants to say it – but I’m gonna speak my mind
We’re all in this together but we’re running out of time


Not for a man like me
Yeah when your back’s up against the wall
And the wolf’s knocking at your door
LISTEN MR. PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE
