We played the garden in New York City
We rocked the house down in New Orleans
We think about the ones we lost along the way
As we're rolling down the road with Mr. Breeze
I have seen a million faces
All staring back at me
And every night we hear them singing Alabama
And I feel the spirits standing next to me
Woh-woh-woh, they're still with us
Woh-woh-woh, we're never alone
Out here on '75 keepin' the dream alive
Highway brothers and midnight riders
We're the last of the street survivors
From California to Carolina
Overseas back to Tennessee
Standing here on the stage I wanna testify
They got the music never went away
Woh-woh-woh, they're still with us
Woh-woh-woh, we're never alone
Out here on '75 keepin' the dream alive
Highway brothers and midnight riders
We're the last of the street survivors
Woh-woh-woh, they're still with us
Woh-woh-woh, we're never alone
Out here on '75 keepin' the dream alive
Highway brothers and midnight riders
Yeah, highway brothers and midnight riders
We're all just street survivors
Yeah, survivors
