Money can't buy you happiness
And that drinking can cause you pain
Yeah that stuff you put up your nose
It can drive you insane
Why do you do these things?
You're killing yourself each day
So you better get down on your knees
And ask the good Lord to take it away

Let the rain stop falling
Let the sun shine again
Let your heart stop crying
Let the good Lord be with you my friend
And start living life again
Time with your family is precious
Take a good look at yourself
You've been burning the candle at both ends
Don't you think it's time to got help?
Let your spirit fly and you won't need to get high anymore
Ask him into your life
Cause he can open up ANY door
