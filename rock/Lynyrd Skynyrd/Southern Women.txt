I'm the kind of man that loves all the girls
From debutantes to honky-tonk queens
I've tasted every brand all around the world
But all I see are peaches in my dreams
I'm talking about, I'm talking about them southern women
It's a well known fact across the Dixie line
And if a man don't agree I can tell you he's blind
They can drink with the best and the hell with the rest
And if she takes you home you ain't getting no rest
I'm talking about, I'm talking about them southern women
I'm talking about they'll love you so slow them southern women
Them southern girls
They look like angels on saturday night oh-lord they got a wild side
Take you places that you've never been make a man come back again
Talk about mama's southern belle little girl learned her lesson well
Ain't no others can cast a spell like the sweet southern women

They can make a man feel so proud they can capture him with a southern style
Little girl learned her lesson well ain't no others can cast a spell
Like the sweet southern women them southern girls
