Angels sing and buzzards fly
Kingdoms fall and rivers rise
It's all the same since a sin is a lie
Some are free but we're all doing time

One day at a time smell the roses taste the wine
One day at a time no stop signs or red lights
That wheel keeps turning on and on, day and night
No one survives ain't no use in crying
What ain't dead is surely dying one day at a time
Money burns and good gold shines
Dreamers dream and finders find
World keeps spinning round and round
Save our souls before it all comes down
