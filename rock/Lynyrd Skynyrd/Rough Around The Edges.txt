I knew a man a long, long time
But I never knew him at all
Small in stature, big at heart
Oh, he always stood tall
From the time that he was born
He had a style all his own
In my mind he could do no wrong
Misunderstood all along
He worked hard all his life
To get what he has today
We would all be better off
If we could hear those words
That he had to say

He took me by the hand
And said, "Son, what's your plan?
I won't stop you or stand in your way
Someday you'll be a man
I look at him with hungry eyes
That only youth can know
With all his wisdom and all his years
He said, "I'll teach you all that you need to know


Don't stop, now, keep moving
Don't worry about where you are going
I'll hear you, you'll feel me
I'm there no matter where you go
