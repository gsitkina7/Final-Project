Oh yeah!
Got a pocket full of memories and my song
Got to keep on movin' and rollin' on
When I'm playin' for keeps, I always win
Don't know where I'm going, but I know where I've been
Yeah!
Looking back when I was a boy
A hand-me-down bike was my toy
A barefoot brother who gave me hell
I learned from the best who taught me well
I hear that highway callin'
Oh, feel the breeze
I've been around playin' and gamblin' but Lord I'm free
Saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dyin' breed
Last of a dyin' breed
One horse towns and one night stands
Just like my daddy, I'm a travelin' man
I'm not the kind to settle down
The roar of the engine, I love that sound
I hear that highway callin'!
Oh, feel the breeze
I've been around playin' and gamblin' but Lord I'm free
Saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dyin' breed
Last of a dyin' breed
Oh, feel the breeze
I've been around playin' and gamblin' but Lord I'm free
Yeah saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Yeah a wide open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dyin' breed
Last of a dyin' breed
Oh yeah
Last of a dyin' breed
