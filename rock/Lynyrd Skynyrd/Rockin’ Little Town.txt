Yeah

Big bad machine still making the scene
Big wheels keep on turning
Step on the gas, gone in a flash
Rubber just keeps on burning

Because every night is a Saturday night
No Matter what town we're in
Open the doors, kick out the lights
Just let the party begin
We're just watching the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to folks like us
Making good music, keeping it alive
Slip in slip out, of your rocking little town tonight
Yeah that's what we do

Get into town, lay our head down
Really there is nothing to do
Watching the clock, get ready to rock
We aren't no different than you


MMMMmmmmm
So good to see you all again
I hope this ride we're on
Oooooh it never ends yeah
OOohhh

"Because We're just watching the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to boys like us
Making good music, keeping it alive
Slip in, slip out
We're going to rock' your little town
Watching the world from this big ass bus
The highway is home to folks like us
Making good music, keeping it alive
Slip in, slip out
Of your rocking little town tonight
Yeah it's what we do
Oohhh we'll see you soon
MMMMMmmmOoooh
Yeah your little rocking town
