Well the sun don't shine where it used to
And the angels are hiding their heads
People don't listen to their hearts anymore
Seems the good men all are dead
There is no right, wrong, no in between
That isn't the constitution that they wrote for me
Got our heads stuck in something overseas
Standing ass deep in hypocracy
Well I found myself out on the open road
Heading out into the desert
Looking for another world that's waiting on me
That none of us can see
I keep thinking to myself as I move along
Where do we all come from
Is there religion or another dimension
Another place and time yeah
OOOooooo

When my life is over and done
Finally made my way through it
Another life has just begun
Is this the way you do it
Oh the way
OOOooooo

Looking in the eyes of the man on the moon
He's staring down at me
Wondering what he's thinking and if he knows
Please let me see
Life is like an open door we're all walking through
Do you know the answers, no one knows the truth
Until we pass on through

OOOOOOoooooo

Walking on the world upside down
It keeps spinning round and round
World upside down
I'm so tired of all this bullshit going down
Finally made my way through it
When my life is over and done
Is this the way you do it
When my life is over and done
Finally made my way through it
Another life has just begun
This is the way you do it
Oh the way
This is the way you do it
Oh the way
