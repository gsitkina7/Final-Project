Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of lonely
Street at Heartbreak Hotel

I get so lonely  baby
I could die

Though the place is crowded
You still can find some room
Where those broken hearted
Lovers cry away their blues
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely, I get so lonely I could die
