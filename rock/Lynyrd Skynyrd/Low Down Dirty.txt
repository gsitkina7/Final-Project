It said 3:30 on my watch
Big show don't start 'till 9:00
Thought a cold one sure would hit the spot
She started pouring shots
It was only me and her in there
Let's get outta here
Might lose my job but I don't care
Come along if you dare
Lay down my tailgate
Hey boy...What'you say?
Do a little day drinking
A little bit of love making
A whole lot of world shaking
Then we'll do it again
Do it again
Start from the sun shining
Go until the stars are in the sky
Boy don't you leave me hanging
Cause it's never too late
To get down and dirty
Oh Down and Dirty

I turned up her radio
She started dancing real slow
Like she was putting on a show
3 hours left to rock and roll
Wet sweat was pouring off her skin
Her body made me wanna sin
Right then my buzz was kicking in
She had a devil's grin
And then a bus drove by
She flipped them the bird
She looked me in the eye and said
You give me the urge!

Do a little day drinking
A little bit of love making
