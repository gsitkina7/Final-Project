He was 5 foot 7
Strong as an Oak tree
Yeah he had a good reason
For every lick he gave me
But he showed me the ropes
Good whiskey and smoke
And how to tell a dirty joke

I had a good teacher
Half devil, half preacher
He made me a believer
I had a good teacher, teacher
Oh Yeah
She was 6 foot 1
Shaking that money thing
I was high school dumb
When I had my first tall one
But she gave me a sip
And a kiss on the lips
She let me give her one more


I graduated from the school of hard knocks yeah
Learned from the best all the tricks to get by
But I gotta give credit where credit is due
I wasn't born no fool


She was my teacher
She was a really good teacher
She made me a believer
Lord I had some good teachers
Some really good teachers!
