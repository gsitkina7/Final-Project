You got to lock your doors, keep the world out
We're closing ourselves in
If you watch the news it'll scare you to death
To Hell and back again
The only justice here's at the wrong end of a gun
Got the criminal making the laws got the good men on the run
I've seen enough
We don't own anything we've got we've giving it all away
But that don't make no sense to me you know who's gonna pay
It's the man in the factory working twelve hours a day
The woman working in the restaurant with another kid on the way
Isn't anything in this life sacred anymore
We can't lose what we've got it's worth fighting for
I've seen enough, I've seen enough to make a grown man cry

A man's standing by the road a sign in his hand
He don't want your charity he says I ain't no begger man
All I need is a chance to get back on my feet
But we just pass him by well it could be you or me
I've seen enough
I ain't the kind to just sit back and watch the world go around
It's not too late to change let's turn this shit around
