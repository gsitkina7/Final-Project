Love this time of year
It seems to bring us near
I wish Christmas was every day

There's something about those lights
On that tree at night
Feeling you girl, next to me
Oh baby, baby the way we kiss
Under the mistletoe
A laugh, like little children
Making angels in the snow
Well, it's in your eyes and in your smile it shows
That this very special time of year
It seems to set your heart a glow
Oh, sing it with me, baby
Oh, it's Christmas, you know it's Christmas
And it's our favorite time of year
Bells will be ringing, our hearts are singing
Well, I'm glad it's Christmas time once again

The city's lit up bright on this starry night
But there's something left to do
Go home and light a fire, tell me your heart's desire
Wrap me up, take me away
Oh, when I'm with you darling
There's so much love that I want to share
I know you feel it too
There's magic in the air
And in this, sweet, sweet memories
We share together
They're going to last us now
Now and for ever, for ever and ever
