Hey, when is the last time you sat down and had dinner with your kids?
Talked about what's going on in their lives?
Hey, when is the last time you just stopped and helped somebody out?
I bet you can't remember
Well a lot of people are saying
We're changing for the better
Well that don't interest me

I like the simple life
The way it USED to be
We left our doors wide open
We didn't need no key
I've been around the world
Seen all there is to see
I'd trade ALL THOSE memories for ONE MORE DAY
How it used to be
I like the Simple Life
I wanna get up Sunday morning
Go fishing with my boy
Watch the sunset kick back in my yard
Take my Harley on a real long lazy Sunday drive
And do a little more nothing once in a while
Yeah Maybe kick my feet up
Watch a little re-run on TV
Laughing with ol Barney, Andy and Aunt Bee


Everything's going by so fast
I swear sometimes we just can't see
So caught up in where we're TRYING to get
Life as we know it, could be gone in a minute
