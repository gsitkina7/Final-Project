Yeah, ooh, ooh, the only time I get up early
Is to met my mules at the fishing hole
I wanna catch the one that got away
I wanna feel my pole bending in that way

Since I was a kid, I felt this way
I fell hook, line and sinker gone fishing, yeah

St. John's River runs north not south
Smart enough to have a large mouth
If you can hook 'em, you can mount 'em
You can keep 'em around
But if they break your line, they're gonna go back down

Oh, ain't nothing like sunrise on the lake
Or when the moon comes up at night
Oh, there's things out there that can take your life
You might just die of fright
But I'll be there come rain or shine
See it's what I like to do
Only thing better than setting the hook
Is setting my hook in you


I've been everywhere, tried everything
But there ain't nothing that feels the same
When you find the right one, it's a magical thing
Next thing you know, it's a diamond ring


Gone, gone fishing, she hooked me
Gone, gone fishing, yeah, yeah
Gone, gone, gone fishing, yeah
She's my baby, gone, gone, gone fishing
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, gone fishing
