I'm just a cityboy
But there's a small town side of me
And I feel it closing in
Are we blind to see
That she's dying more each day
And she's crying out to you and me
Changes come and when they're gone
They curse the fools who wait too long

So let's take care of what we have
Before the good we know goes bad
And the beauty fades and just slips away
The dirty air,the dying seas
Will this be the world we leave
To the wild and young
I say,just look at what we've done
And right before our eyes
Today's yesterday
Will be tomorrow's goodbye

Here comes the rain
And it might wash her tears away
But it doesn't change a thing
Like my brother before me
All I can do is write this song
And for her I sing

Do you ever think about
The future or the past
Do you ever wonder
How long this world will last
