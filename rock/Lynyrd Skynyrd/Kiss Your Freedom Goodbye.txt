I don't read the paper, I don't watch the news
Life's good in this small town, population 62
Our bank ain't been held-up since 1932
Our doors are always unlocked
But not for long I'm telling you

Because I know time's are gonna change
I know life will never be the same
I see please tell me it ain't so
They're all moving in surrounding me
No place left to go
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye
Used to have a small town drugstore
Where old men liked to meet
That store's gone out of business
They're selling drugs out in the streets
The new kids like to spray paint
They've got a lot to say
Sure do have a way with words
Taught me a few today

Because I know time's are gonna change
I know life will never be the same
I see small town folks like me
Are gonna have to change the way we do things cause eventually
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye
Kiss it goodbye
