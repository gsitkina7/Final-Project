That's right, come on

Long tall Sally's looking good to me
Shaking that thing for everybody to see
Oh, everybody's thinking just like me
Wonder who the lucky fool's gonna be

Get it while the getting good, baby
Take it cause the others would
Ain't no hesitating, they just might be waiting
Get it while the getting good
Look at that dude in the parking lot
Taken it for granted, everything he's got
So if he hands you a dollar say, "Thank you, sir"
Cause I've been up and down and I know what it's worth


You know I gotta have it, ain't no doubt about it
Get it while the getting good
You can say you don't want it
But deep inside you know, you really do
You know what I'm talking about
Well, everybody's thinking just like me
Wonder who the lucky fool's gonna


You gotta get it while the getting good
You gotta get it while the getting good, baby
You gotta get it while the getting good
Oh, you better get it while the getting good, baby
