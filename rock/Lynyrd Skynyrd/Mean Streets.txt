Raised up with two kinds of people
The good ones and the bad
I was taught from early on
The only choice I had
Now I see, it's clear to me
What was in the plan
Had to walk the walk and talk the talk
And try to be a man
I swear the wind took me away
But now I'm here again today, yeah
I'm back on the mean streets
Oh, it's the only thing I know
Never change me, it was born in my soul
And it don't take much to make me mad
Push me a little and I bring back
I've a mean streak, oh
Yeah, I'm back on the mean streets

Somebody stole my money
I heard a brother say
Used to we'd fight it out
That was yesterday
Just because you're packing son
Don't make you a man
If you shoot to kill, what's the thrill
Why don't you understand
Each time I walk outside my door
We need a change and that's for sure


Do you ever think about where you're goin'?
Have you ever thought about where you've been?
Will you ever pass this way again?
There's a fear and you know it
But inside, you can't show it
No where for you to run and hide
