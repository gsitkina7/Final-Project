Up every morning before the sun
Taking my loving on the run
Breaking my back till the day is done
I'm gonna punch that time clock and have some fun
Ain't no easy way to get myself out

So - I keep on working
Like a working man do
I gotta buy my baby shoes
I keep on working
It's the only thing to do
I make my living by the sweat of my brow
Oh - working just like you-uh
I was raised on the poor side of town
I made my living moving around
I never let no one dog me down
Oh I was taught to stand my ground
Life was always changing
That's just the way it is


Aaah ah ah ah aaah ah ah ah
I keep on working-working
Uh oh oh oh
