Are you a saint then don't be a stranger
Were you sent down from Heaven to show me the way
And if you ain't then I see a danger
You better take a minute and hear what I've got to say

Because I'll keep on trying to put it straight to you
You better give it straight to me
Because most women seem to have a good time
Making a fool out of me
I'm keeping my faith I've made up my mind
I've got nothing left to lose just lay it on the line
I'm keeping my faith yea I'll find the one
Who won't steal me blind who won't turn and run
I'm keeping my faith I'm trusting in you
So don't treat me like those other ones do
Ain't no getting 'round it tell me to my face
Do you think I'm a fool for keeping my faith in you
I'll treat you right I'll do you better
I won't disappoint you I won't make you cry
My friends tell me if you let her
She'll empty your pockets she'll spend you dry
