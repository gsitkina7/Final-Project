Just when you think you’ve got it figured out
It comes along and hits you in the mouth
You think your day can’t get no worse
Your Heaven falls and hits you where it hurts
You wake up smiling on a sunny day
The clouds pour in and then it’s pouring rain

If you blink you’ll miss it
‘Cause life’s twisted
Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man – it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a back road in the country
Like a switch blade in an alley
Let me tell you boy – you better watch your back
Life’s twisted like that
Yeah Life’s Twisted
You build your dreams with your own two hands
You find out life has other plans
You think you finally found the one way out
You’re driving North but you’re flying South
Sometime’s you’ve gotta risk it
‘Cause life’s twisted
Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man – it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a back road in the country
Like a switch blade in an alley
Let me tell you boy – you better watch your back


Life’s Twisted
Like a black snake on a highway
Like a flat tire on a Friday
If you let it man – it’s gonna kick your ass
Life’s twisted like a back road in the country
Like a switch blade in an alley
Let me tell you boy – you better watch your back

Yeah Life’s Twisted
Life’s Twisted
Oh
Life’s Twisted
Life’s Twisted like that
Life’s Twisted like that
Life’s Twisted
