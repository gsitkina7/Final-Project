I ain't the kind to stick around without it
It'd be a crime cause man I'm all about it
It's in my blood
It keeps me breathing
It's like a drug - gotta have the feeling

It's been awhile since I've seen your face
What a shame, what a waste
I've been up, I've been down
I've been kicked to the ground
But I can't get my mind off of you
So I keep on moving on to a place I belong
Hoping you wanted me to
I'm better than I was before
I'm knocking at your door
I'm coming back for more

Some say it's love
Some say it's hate
I'm here to tell you it's never too late
If you don't use it
Man you're gonna lose it
Your sweet little nothings are what I call music



I keep coming back, coming back for more
