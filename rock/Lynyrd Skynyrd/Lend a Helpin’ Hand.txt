Oh. Now when you think the times, babe
Take a look around
Because babies are dying from disease
Sleeping out on the ground
People never seen the tortured eyes
From a foreign land. No
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helping hand
You better, lend a helping hand. If you can
Lend a helping hand
Do it if you can
Oh. Every time you feed your face
Do you bow your head
Hunger kills each and every day
Won't you share your bread
If you've ever felt the pain inside
I know you'd understand
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helping hand
You better, lend a helping hand. If you can
Lend a helping hand
Do it if you can
Oh. Every time you feed that face
Do you look around
For somebody right in your own neighborhood
Sleeping out on the ground
And do some down south juking
If you've ever felt the pain inside
I know you'd understand
When you see somebody who's down and out
Lend a helping hand
Why don't you, lend a helping hand. If you can
Lend a helping hand
Won't you please lend a helping hand
