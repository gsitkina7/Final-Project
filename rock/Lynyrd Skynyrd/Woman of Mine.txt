Mornin' to you, love
And it's time to rise
Won't you roll it over
Show me that you're mine
And before I leave you lady... well I, well I must say
That I'm gonna' miss you woman in a each and every way yeah
Told you I love that woman of mine... she's so fine
Sun comes shining down as I roll along
It's just been two short hours since, since I've been gone
But I'm thinking about my woman, and the night before
I'm gonna miss that dark haired lady
Gonna' make love to her for sure
Talking about, woman of mine... I can't let her go
She's a woman of mine... can't let her go...
She's thе kind of woman that you love
She's the kind that you need
It seems to bе her every purpose
Just to see you priest
She makes me feel so good lord
She don't wing you along
And that's why I got these blues as I'm traveling on
It's about a woman of mine... she's a loving soul
Oh she's a woman of mine... can't let her go... no no no
She's the kind you need
Seems to be her every purpose
Just to see you priest
Then she makes you feel so good lord
She don't wing you along
That's why I got these blues and I'm traveling on
It's about a woman of mine and I love her so
Well she's a woman of mine... can't let her go
No and I'm talking about a woman of mine and I love her so
Well she's a woman of mine, I can't let her go... no
