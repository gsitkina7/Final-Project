Your love does something to me that I can't describe
Dark eyes see right through me and I just can't hide
You drive me crazy with what you don't say and the way you hold back love
Tell me tell me won't you please please tell me
Need an answer from above
There you are, You're my desire, and here I am
I'd be a liar if I said

I am not going to crawl
You are not going to nail my heart to the wall
You aren't going to find me crying like a child just asking for it all
I am not going to beg, I'd rather lose it all instead
If that is what it takes to get you Part of me just might let you
For someone like you, I'd do more than fall
I just might crawl
Seems like I get this feeling this time of night
Head down senses reeling, something just isn't right
Imagination locked up inside and it's got nowhere to go
I see my lover through another's eyes
And it's killing me to know the truth
Like playing with fire To lose you
I'd be a liar if I said
