She'd wake us up early every morning
She'd help us say our prayers every night
She was always there to help us through the hard times
We could count on her to make everything alright

I remember swinging on the front porch
Papa said there's something I need to say tonight
Mama's been sick for a long time
Let's pray to God she can make it through the night
Mama don't want to say goodbye
She said wipe those tears from your eyes
Mama I don't wanna say goodbye
It was written in the Heavens and the skies above
Son I gave you birth showed you all my love
I can't think of this life without you it's hard to try
Mama I'm afraid to say goodbye

Now kids I've been hanging on a long time
I hate to leave this world before your grown
Remember everything that I've taught you
Remember all the good times when I'm gone


She whispered in my ear before she passed away
Son it's time to be a man ain't nothing left to say
Jesus walked on water I know it's true
When it comes time he'll call you home
I hope your ready too
