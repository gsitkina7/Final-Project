Every woman's out there looking for a rich man
And every man's out there looking for a perfect ten
Can't always get what you want sometimes
So your better off just taking what you can
Money won't make you happy baby
And a perfect woman son's gonna make you sad
If you think that's where it's at, then I'm telling you, your wrong
Cause you can have it all one day and then it's gone
You can search all of your life, and still not find
What you want, ain't what you've got
Good loving so hard to find
Could this be the right place, at the right time
Good loving, feels so fine
I just can't get enough
Because good loving's hard to find,so hard to find

We all need good loving
Ain't talking about no one night stand
Some have the touch, and others just a hand
But when you find the right one then you'll understand
Can't always get what you want sometimes
So you're better off just taking what you can
You can search all of your life, and still not find
What you want ain't what you've got

Good loving so hard to find
Could this be the right place at the right time
Good loving feels so fine
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Some of that good good love
Good loving
So hard to find
Good loving
Make you loose your mind
Good loving
Good good love
Good loving
Some of that loving baby
