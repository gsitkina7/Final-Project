And we could fight this all night long
There is no right - there is no wrong
Love ain't easy - sometimes it is so blind
The things we said were not so kind

What you see is what you get
I ain't that old - I'm not dead yet
All those words we said
Are in my head
Now all I got left
Is this Sad Song
Something old and something new
Something borrowed but now I'm blue
I stood against the world with you
But now I know baby our love is through


After all this time gone by
Now I sit here and wonder why
Yeah - I'm still here and baby you are gone
All I got left
Is this Sad Song
Sad sad song
Oh
