Well, it looks like it's another
Skynard family Christmas time
Well, well, well, well

Seems like ? New Year's Day
Started out in old L.A
Those big wheels keep turning once again
But this bus we ride, we call our home
Well, this what keeps us moving on
But 11 months on this road, I'm going home
Family say they're trimming the tree
Cooking that turkey, waiting on me
Just like Santa, I'll be right on time
Thirty eight will be there too
CDB will be guiding you
To another Christmas time
Sleigh bells ringing, children singing
It's another Skynard family Christmas time
Oh, pick an excuse
That's right, dig deep
Christmas time


Well, it's another Skynard family Christmas time
Yeah, it's another Skynard family Christmas time
That's right
It's another Skynard family Christmas time
