Yeah she's sitting at the table looking down at her drink
She's always on time - I'm always running late
Yeah I was on my way
But I got sidetracked
Yeah Gary called me up
Said Rickey's in a jam
Come on over brother - She'll understand
Meet me at the truck
We got some planning to do
I've been bad
I've been good
Don't always do the things that I should
When I go - I go all night
But when I do it wrong
I do it up right

I looked at my watch - it was a quarter to three
I knew she'd be up there waiting on me
I-I-I-I got some explaining to do


So I headed straight home
I ain't gonna lie
Ain't got no excuses
No alibi's
I said I was sorry
She said I've heard it before
Some come on over here boy

Baby I do it up right
Oh I'm going to do it up right
Oh, I do it up right
