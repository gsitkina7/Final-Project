Mama called this morning, said
'Son won't you come back home?
I ain't been feeling good and
I know it won't be long
Don't keep me waiting
I wanna touch your face again
Oh, what a good life it's been

Now I'm ready to fly
I wanna see your daddy again
I'm ready to fly
All my family and friends
I know they're out there waiting
In a place beyond the sky
I'm ready to fly
Hard times of '69
The war was raging on
That's the reason my daddy left
And never made it back home
It was tough for all of us
But mama smiled everyday
Oh, it's so hard to hear her say


She made sure she'd never let us see her cry
But those tears on the pillow she couldn't hide
