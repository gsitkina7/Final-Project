When I was a kid I loved hangin' out
Down at the ol' dirt track
Was my dream to be out there
The leader of the pack
I had to wait all week for Sunday
But it never comes too fast
When they hit that track
They ain't lookin' back
They're gonna give no price to blast
:
It's a white knuckle ride
There's only one thing on my mind
It's being the first to cross that finish line
White knuckle ride
I love leavin' y'all behind
If I don't run out of gas
And my tires will last
I'm gonna take that checkered flag
:
Well I love my job 'cause I love my car
When I hear that engine roar
Strap me in, let the race begin
I put the pedal to the floor
Now I got me a big time sponsor
The best crew workin' for me
But I ain't any different
Than the way I used to be
:
It's a white knuckle ride
There's only one thing on my mind
It's being the first to cross that finish line
White knuckle ride
I love leavin' y'all behind
If I don't run out of gas
And my tires will last
I'm gonna take that checkered flag
That crash and burn
You can take that turn
A little bit too fast
But that's a chance you take
Putting on the brakes
Being let up off the gas

It's a white knuckle ride
There's only one thing on my mind
It's being the first to cross that finish line
White knuckle ride
I love leavin' y'all behind
If I don't run out of gas
And my tires will last
I'm gonna take that checkered flag

Come on, boys
White knuckle ride
White knuckle ride
White knuckle ride
White knuckle ride
