Now Mama's in the kitchen cooking
And her children are fast asleep
It's time for Santa Claus to make his midnight creep cause

Santa Claus wants some loving
Santa Claus wants some loving

I know there's something real pretty
Underneath that Christmas tree
But I haven't had no loving and it's wearing me because

Now I been trying to fix this old bicycle
Can't seem to find my pliers
Halfway watching Mama for that sleep in her eyes because


I don't want no turkey
Don't care about no cake
I want you to come here Mama before the children wake because


Now Christmas is for the children
And I want them to be real pleased
But right now Mama it's Christmas Eve
Come make your Papa happy please
