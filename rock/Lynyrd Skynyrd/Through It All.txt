Dig down and tell me what you find
Back in the pages left behind
Everybody's got a story
Ours ain't no different from the rest
Each step we take, it's just a test
On this broken road to glory

When we were young and brave
We fought to save the one thing that we loved
We took a sacred vow
And signed our names in blood
And through it all, we kept on shining
We fought the doubt and faced the pain
We built it up from dust and ashes
To cheat the odds and rise again

There's been a million miles of road
Another million miles to go
Still giving me a reason
Most times your first could be your last
God give me one more second chance
Oh, something to believe in
And though it's easier to give it up
Than to give it all you got
Don't let it make you something
That you're not


And through it all the wheels keep turning
Above the tears the truth stands tall
Now here we are one in spirit
We stand together through it all
Oh, through it all
