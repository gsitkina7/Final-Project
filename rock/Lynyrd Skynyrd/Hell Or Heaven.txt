Mama used to say to me, you can make your destiny
Keep your feet planted on the ground
You can always get it back, make a castle from a one room shack
It's all of what you make of what you've found
Son you're gonna find out when you're older
There's always been the hand of god resting right there on your shoulder

Will it be hell or heaven on earth
The choice is up to you
Look to the sky, the answer is clear
Are you going to, live life for all it's worth
Choose hell, or heaven on earth
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear
Because you'll find heaven right here
Saw a man the other day, had it made in every way
Till his greed brought him down
He was blinded by the city lights, now he shivers in the cold tonight
Who will save the lifeguard when he's about to drown


You know you're going to walk through fire
You know your going to feel the pain
Oh you're going to lose, if you want to win the game
And everytime your heart is breaking
And everytime your faith is shaken
Remember what mama said... Oh that day
Hope when my time has come
I've left enough to build upon
No one going to say I didn't try
Here's why
