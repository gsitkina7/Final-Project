I hear rumors flying
About a head on crash
At the stroke of midnight
When centuries clash
Some going to party
Some going to kneel and pray
Well you can quote the bible
Bribe the devil
But there's gonna be some hell to pay
We were young and innocent
Thought this day would never come
And tomorrow seemed a million miles away
Let's look each other in the eyes
And realize it could be time
To set aside our anger
And know we're all the same
Take my hand we're gonna cross the line
To a brand new day on the end of time
We're gonna rise as one or fall together
Out here on the ledge
We're standing on the edge...of forever

From the silence I hear the thunder roll
Words of the prophets echo in my soul
One salvation in the world to me
I know in my heart if we love each other
We can face what's meant to be
Now there's power in the wrong hands
A madman in a foreign land
If we don't get our senses
It's all gonna slip away
