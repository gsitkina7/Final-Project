Woman lose my number
You can't get to me
My pockets ain't deep enough
Your eyes were seeing green
I caught you lying, you're a cheat
Oh Lord shame on me
I loved you once
Tried you twice
But you've become bad company
Somebody call the rescue
'Cause I think I'm on the edge
Yeah you're just like a sledgehammer
You keep pounding in my head
While you were on the phone lying to me
You were lying next to who
It ain't nothing to do about the heartache
It's just a little thing called you

All my friends did tell me
But I could not believe
Well you were doing me wrong
When I was gone
How wicked can you be?
Yeah a black cat crosses many roads
Chills you to the bone
I might be hurt, but I won't cry
'Cause I'm a man that's not alone
