Every time I think I got it all figured out
Then I draw a blank and my whole world crashes down
So many people have got it worse than me
But that could change tomorrow, ain't no guarantee

How soon we forget
To count every blessing
If you think you got it bad take a look around
How soon we forget
That life is one big lesson
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again
How soon we forget
Got a friend of mine who says he's run all out of luck
But he'll be fine, cause he just ain't drunk enough
The world is empty when you're slamming those shots down
How can you be happy, son when the devil's hanging 'round


Just remember, thank God you're here today
If you got the will you can find a way
How soon we forget... oh, baby


Soon we all forget
How soon we forget
Soon we forget.. ooh
Take a look around and you will see
Soon we all forget... oh

So many people have got it worse than me
Oh.. can't you see
How soon we all forget
