There's a honky-tonk just south of Georgia
A little salvation just a' waiting for ya'
I heard it said a long time ago
If your looking for your soul
Down a dirt road just across the border

Well the harder it comes you know the easier it goes
If you can make your way a little further down that road, yea
When your caught up in between
Or just dying to be set free
South of Heaven
Always ending up
No matter how I try
I'm just south of Heaven
Don't want to think you can have it all
Because all I need is just south of Heaven

There's a little girl they call the sweet thing
Been some time I'd like to tell you one thing
You have nothing left to lose
So by the time that you come to
You'll be one more calling her name

Well the harder it comes you know the easier it goes
If you can make your way a little further down that road, yea
When your caught up in between
Or just dying to be set free




All I want, all I need, all I want
Is south of Heaven
