You better listen my brother
Cause if you do you can hear
There are voices still calling from across the years
And they're crying across the ocean
And they're crying across the land
And they will until we all come to understand

That none of us are free
None of us are free
None of us are free if one of us is chained
None of us are free
Well there are people in the darkness
And they just can't see the light
And if we don't say it's wrong then that says it's right
We got to feel for each other
Let our brothers know we're here
Got to get the message and send it out loud and clear


Well I swear to you salvation isn't very hard to find
None of us can find it on our own
We got to join together. Spirit, heart and mind
All the are suffering, knows they're not alone


If you just look around you
You're see what I say
Cause the world's getting smaller each passing day
Now it's time to make some changes
Now it's time all realized
That the truth is shining right before our eyes

Well it's the very heart of humanity
Cause none of us are free if one of us is chained
None of us are free
