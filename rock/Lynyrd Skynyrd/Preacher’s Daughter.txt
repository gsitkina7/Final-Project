Well, just keep on running mama, until you can't run no more
You know your sister told your mama 'bout the boy next door
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no
Well, I seen you through your window, baby, many times before
Yeah there's a hundred different lovers knockin' on your back door
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no
Well, keep on running mama, until you can't get no ?
You're just a no good woman lord, I ain't lying
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no
And I'm talking about the preacher's daughter
Doing what she hadn't ought to
Getting on down
With every stud in town
