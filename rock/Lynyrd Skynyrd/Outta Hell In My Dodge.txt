Five a.m. in the morning, whiskey still running through my head
I could get out of bed and maybe I'll just have another cigarette
As long as I can remember seems all I've ever done is work
The boss is a jerk and I ain't paying the rent
Spent my whole life shovelin' dirt

I'm going to get outta Hell in my Dodge
Can't take this anymore
Going to go downtown pick up my girl
There ain't nothing worth waiting for
Take the road less traveled
Spend my life behind the wheel
Gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge
Freedom made out of steel
There's a knock on the door from the Sheriff
Asking me where I was last night
Seems somebody looking a lot like me
Had taking up with his wife
He said son if I ever catch him
There's going to be some hell to pay
He'll be gone for good if I see him again
Because I just might blow him away


What's a poor man supposed to do
Stuck in the middle and trapped by the blues
Baby, I'm sick of these blues

I'm going to get outta Hell in my Dodge
Can't take this anymore
Going to go downtown pick up my girl
There ain't nothing worth waiting for
Well I Don't care if I'm wrong or right
Gotta split this town tonight
Going to get outta Hell in my Dodge
Live my life behind the wheel
I'm Gonna get outta Hell in my Dodge
My freedom made out of steel
