MMMMmmmmmm
Hahaaa
Let me tell you a story

Outside of Macon off a country road
Justice was forsaken when they let the wrong man go
Johnny Law was shady first one on the scene
They called it murder in the first degree
Dead man walking, walking down the hall
Judge says guilty but still he's standing tall
Dead man walking they say he broke the law
Taking the life of another man who done his daughter wrong
Light them up, lay them down
Take them out but there's more of us around
When wrong is right and right is wrong
Oh there's a dead man walking tonight
Walk on

If I ask you a question, would you tell the truth
Would you pull the triger if you were standing in his shoes
Dead man walking I know what I'd do
If someone hurt my baby I'd be walking too


Yeah
So if I ask you that question, would you tell the truth?
Ahaha...Dead man walking
MMMMMmmmmm
