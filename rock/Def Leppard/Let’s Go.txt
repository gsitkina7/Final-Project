Do you really, really wanna do this now?
Do you really, really wanna do this now?
Do you really, really wanna do this now?
Do you really, really wanna do this
The heat goes up as the lights go down
The beat goes on when we hit your town
You overload on electric light
There's magic in the air tonight
Welcome to the carnival
Welcome to the party
Welcome to the edge of your seat
Let's go
Let's go
Do you really wanna do this now?
Let's go
Let's go
Do you really, wanna do this now?
Your heart is beating like a drum
So step right up 'cos your time has come
Gotta stand up gotta get in line
Come take a look, it'll blow your mind
Welcome to the carnival
Welcome to the party
Welcome to the edge of your seat
Let's go
Let's go
Do you really wanna do this now?
Let's go
Let's go
Do you really wanna do this now?
Do this now?
Magic and wonder will hit you like thunder
The feeling gets stronger so let yourself go
Welcome to the carnival
Welcome to the party
Welcome to the edge of your seat
Let's go
Let's go
Do you really wanna do this now?
Let's go
Let's go
Do you really wanna do this now?
Let's go
Let's go
Do you really wanna do this now?
Let's go
Go
Do you (do you) really (really), wanna do this now?
