Well, we were getting ready just the other night
When a knock on the dressing room door
Gave way to a leather jacket little girl
Who we'd never ever seen before
In her red satin dress and her high heeled shoes
She took us all by surprise
And when she asked us what we wanted to do
Well, she said it with her eyes
Just get your rocks off
When we finally took the stage there she was
But she wasn't on her own
Because she'd brought some friends maybe 5 or 6
Yeah, she must have been on the phone
And when they started dancing and jumping around
Well we couldn't believe our eyes
Because they'd got the whole damn audience rocking
And they'd got us paralyzed
Just get your rocks off
