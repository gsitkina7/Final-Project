I see my life go flashing by
At the mercy of your call
Sailin' in on broken wings
I'm not ready for the fall
(Whoa) So pick up the pieces
(Whoa) Get on the right track
(Whoa) Let's make a connection
Turn me on 'cause I want
My life back
SOS emergency
Come break me out
Come set me free
I'm in a crisis, can't you see?
It's sweet surrender
Rescue me
Running out of chances
I'm just waiting for a sign
This heavy heart is
Under pressure
And beating out of time
(Whoa) So get me connectеd
(Whoa) Pull me out of the road
(Whoa) My cardiac is arrestеd
Plug me in and watch my mind explode
SOS emergency
Set all those lifeboats
Out to sea
I'm in a crisis, hear my plea
Call all the angels
Rescue me
(Whoa) So pick up the pieces
(Whoa) Get on the right track
(Whoa) Let's make a connection
Turn me on 'cause I want my life
Turn me on, just turn me on
SOS emergency
An alternate reality
I'm in a crisis desperately
It's terminal
Rescue me
SOS emergency
Come break me out
Come set me free
I'm in a crisis, can't you see?
It's cataclysmic
Rescue me
Rescue, rescue, rescue me
