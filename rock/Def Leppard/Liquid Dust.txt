Phase away
Laze away
Dreaming of that feeling
A hazy way
Came to play
Through that window
Came a castaway
There's not enough hours in the day
And all the rains that came my way
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Flows like a river
Going down to the ocean
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Floats like a stream
Going over and over
Broken glass
This too shall pass
That sensation of elation
Golden throne
Sits all alone
I should've known
That bird had flown
There's not enough hours in the day
And all the rains they came today
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Flows like a river
Going down to the ocean
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Floats like a stream
Going over and over
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Flows like a river
Going down to the ocean
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Floats like a stream
Going over and over
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Flows like a river
Going down to the ocean
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Floats like a stream
Going over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
