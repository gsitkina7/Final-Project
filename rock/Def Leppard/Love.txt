Love, love look what you've done to my heart
Oh, I should have known from the start
That you'd go and tear it apart
Oh, and now you desert me

You never lose, you never fail
You always live to tell the tale
You take me up, you bring me down
Without a touch, without a sound
Love, love why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms then let me go

Oh, how long must it be until you
Come and run back to me?
Can't you see I got no release from the pain
Just to see you again



Love, don't let me go
When will your love set me free?
When will you come back to me?
