I'm caught in a dream
Sometimes it ain't what it seems
I'm all in a daze
Can't find my way out of this maze
I'm looking for clues
And wanting a change in the rules
I'm locked in a cage
Acting out on the wrong stage
Don't want your sympathy, no no no
Don't need the third degree, no no no
Just got to break away and scream
I'm caught in a dream
I'm stood at the edge and I'm looking down
Caught in the danger zone
I feel like a king that has lost his crown
And now I stand here alone
Don't want your sympathy, no
Don't need the third degree, no
Just got to break away and scream
I'm caught in a dream
Fractured love, fractured love
Iron fist in a velvet glove
Fractured Love, fractured love
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love
I don't care if you pull down the sky
Angry passion is a friend of mine
