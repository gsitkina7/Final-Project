I don't know how to leave you and I don't know how to stay
I've got things that I must tell you that I don't know how to say
The man behind these empty words is crying out in shame
Holding on to this sinking ship when nothing else remains

All I want is everything, am I asking too much?
All I want is everything like the feel of your touch
But all I have are yesterdays, tomorrow never comes
It's hard to hold your head up when you're kneeling down to pray
And the talking doesn't come easy now when the words get in the way
And if you could see what's going on behind these private eyes
The truth would look so easy now but I'm running out of lies


You think the shadow of doubt is hanging over my head
It's just an angel whose wings hide the sun
And it's myself I betray I can not wish this away
Took my chance now the damage is done, hey
