I'm heading for a heartache
'Cause there's a hurricane coming my way
Can't hold me down forever
So cut me loose before I fade away
I'm not ready for judgement day
This ain't no make believe but
I should've listened to my heart this time
'Cause I can barely breathe
My pulse is racin' like the scene of a crime
So good it can't be legal
So dangerous and lethal
And you know it
Good love's so hard to find now
So, opеn up your mind now
I'm about to blow it
Just look at these chains
I'm tied up and insanе
(Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable)
Just look at these chains
Yes, I'll say it again
It's unmistakably love
You got me bustin' out
These flames of love could set this house on fire
So come on, take a chance
Come on, don't make me dance alone
We can take this higher
Just look at these chains
I'm tied up and insane
(Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable)
Just look at these chains
Yes, I'll say it again
It's unmistakably love
Just look at these chains
I'm tied up and insane
(Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable)
Just look at these chains
Yes, I'll say it again
Oh, no, no, no, no
Just look at these chains
I try to break them in vain
Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable
Just look at these chains
Let me say it again
It's unmistakably love
