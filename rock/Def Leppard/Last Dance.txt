Do you remember
When we used to dance?
Lighting up the universe
Living life for what it's worth
We took a chance
Do you remember
When we used to sing?
Shooting stars across the sky
A fire that would never die
It was everything
It was all that we wanted
And there was everything we'd need
We were gonna live forever
'cos we believed
Do you remember
When we used to play?
We were right and we were wrong
Dancing to a different song every day
We were gonna live forever
Is this our last chance?
Is this our last try?
Is this our last dance
Before we turn around
And say goodbye?
Do you remember when we used to dance?
