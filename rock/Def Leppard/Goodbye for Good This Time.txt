How many times has tomorrow
Been promised to someone?
How many chances came
When tomorrow was already gone?
How many times will truth
And forgiveness stand in our way?
There's a lie in belief
The heart is a thief every time
Where does the future lie
In this godforsaken place?
The heart has a dark devotion
And it breaks you leaving no trace
This is a song of survival
But the tune is starting to fade
There's nowhеre to run
Nowhere to hidе anymore
It's goodbye for good this time
As love lies broken in two
I'd move Heaven and Earth this time
To cross that wasteland with you
I'm walking into the storm
Just as the night brings the dawn
I am reborn
It's goodbye for good this time
As love lies broken in two
I'd move Heaven and Earth this time
To cross that wasteland with you
It's goodbye for good this time
As love slips into the night
I'd move Heaven and Earth this time
I've one last battle to fight
I'm walking into the storm
Just as the night brings the dawn
I am reborn
