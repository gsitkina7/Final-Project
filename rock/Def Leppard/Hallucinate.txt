Your access
Undeniable, unattainable is what you are
In a word indestructible
You're a cannonball, you're a star

Getting wild, getting free
Getting touched, can't you see?
Getting first guarantee
Get your hands off of me
Hallucinate, it's in your head
Hallucinate in every word you say
Hallucination, hallucinate
It's more than you can take

It's the way you react, it's the way you feel
In your Cadillac, in your car
Because you choose to wear anything you dare
Like a superstar is what you are
Let it loose, let it go
Be the last to know
Get it back, get on track
Be the first to cry

Hallucinate, hallucination
