Let me down slow and easy
Because there ain't nothing I can do
I hope and pray, my faith won't leave me
When it comes down to me and you

Try a little tenderness
I die a little
For a long lost sweet caress
You lying next to me
Fulfilled some destiny
I want to cry
But I breathe a sigh
Just a little bit of letting go
I don't want you to know
I want to cry
But I breathe a sigh

Overflow of emotion
And a hurt that'll never heal
If you close the door forever
The fate of pain is sealed



I more than long for your affection
You tell me now that ain't so
Not even gentle persuasion
Is ever going to let me go

Won't you let me breathe?
Won't you let me breathe?
Let me breathe
Won't you let me breathe?
Breathe a sigh
Won't you let me breathe?
Won't you let me breathe?
Breathe a sigh
Won't you let me breathe?
