Hello America, hello America
Hello America, hello America

Well I'm taking me a trip I'm going down to California
Yeah, I'm going to try Hollywood and San Pedro Bay
I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I'm going to give my love to you
I'm going to take you where the lights are bright
I'm going to give you my love tonight
Hello America, hello America
Hello America, hello America

I'm going to get me a greyhound bus down the motorway
I'm going to spend a little time in Frisco and L.A
But when it gets to twelve o'clock
And you feel that you got to rock
You'd better let your hair hang down
So we can boogie all over town

Hello America, hello America
Hello America, hello America

Well I'm taking me a trip I'm going down to California
Yeah, I'm going to try Hollywood and San Pedro Bay
I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I'm going to give my love to you
I'm going to take you where the lights are bright
I'm going to give you my love tonight

Hello America, hello America
Hello America, hello America
Hello America, hello America
Hello America, hello America
