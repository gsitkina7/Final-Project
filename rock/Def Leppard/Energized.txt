I'm the rhythm king from coast to coast
Shot out the gate first to the post
My pulse is set on overdrive
Beat cardiac means I'm alive
I get to feed the need for speed
Heat and sweat are what I bleed
Radial philosophy
It's what you feel not what you see
It's dangerous and shameless
When I get to look at you
I'm erratic when I'm static
I'm about to overload
I'm feeling energized
Like I've been hypnotized
I'm feeling energized
And I'm in paradise
A firestorm identity
It's what I am, it's what I'll be
The undisputed number one
Laser fired from a gun
To liberate that's what you need
Heat and spice are what I breathe
Insatiable and chemical
And viral beyond animal
It's ageless and contagious
When I get to look at you
I'm erratic when I'm static
I'm about to overflow
I'm feeling energized
Like I've been hypnotized
I'm feeling energized
And I'm in paradise
I'm feeling energized
Like I've been hypnotized
I'm feeling energized
And I'm in paradise
I'm feeling energized
Like I've been hypnotized
I'm feeling energized
And I'm in paradise
