I couldn't breathe
As I watched you leave
I thought we had something
But I wanted more
I played my cards
But I pushed you too hard
I feel like a shipwreck
Washed up on your shore
Something's happening
That I couldn't see
I can't get my head around
What you did to me
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone
You left mе down on my knees
You let me go (You let mе)
You left me lifeless
I can't let go
It's body and soul
I'm drowning in memories
So just throw me a line
I feel betrayed
And my nerves are all frayed
Like the last rose of summer
As it dies on the vine
Something's happening
But I didn't know
I can't turn the time back
And it's starting to show
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (Cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (Take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
I just can't believe
A word they said
I've got these voices in my head
And they won't leave me alone
So come on now, come in
From the cold
Don't leave me lifeless
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (Cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (Take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (Cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (Take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (You let me, you let me)
You left me lifeless
