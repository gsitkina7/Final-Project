When God is asleep
And the world is wide open
It's fallen for a beautiful lie
We're in this too deep
The timeline is broken
Just like a shadow frozen in time
Open your eyes
'Cause looking up ain't what it seems
When it crushes all your dreams
Open your eyes
Oh, this feeling's nothing new
So let the truth wash over you
I'm tired of this game
Come down from your mountain
We're lost in all this darkness and fear
And all that we crave
Is a seat at your table
Come feed us, watch this pain disappear
Open your eyes
'Cause looking up ain't what it seems
When it crushes all your dreams
Open your eyes
Oh, this feeling's nothing new
So let the truth wash over you
So, what have we done?
Heaven knows which way we'll go
As we lie wide awake and dreaming
We stare at the sun
Watch the dying of the light
As the colours turn to black and white
Open your eyes
'Cause looking up ain't what it seems
When it crushes all your dreams
Open your eyes
Oh, this feeling's nothing new
So let the truth wash over you
