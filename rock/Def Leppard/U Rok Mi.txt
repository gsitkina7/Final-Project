No matter what you breathe
It's where we at
We're more like make-believe
In white and black
Come-a-start me up
Come on up and make a sound
Shake me like a shock
Come and shake me to the ground
Uh!
Shock!
Shock!
In the darkness
I saw the light
The sorest eyes
The sharpest sight
A supernova
A black hole
Took out my senses
I took complete control
When that feeling starts to show
I lеt that soul-glow flow
Oh-oh, oh, oh
You rock me
Come on and rock me
You rock mе
Come on and rock me
I think it's too late
To save my soul
Some kinda power
Is swallowing me whole
So when the light is dark
I make my stand
I love you like a song
Only you can turn me on
Come and take me by the hand
When that feeling starts to show
I let that soul-glow flow
Oh-oh, oh, oh
You rock me
Come on and rock me
You rock me
Come on and rock me
Shock!
Shock!
Shock!
Interstellar, outer space
Inspiration, human race
You rock me
Come on and rock me
You rock me
Come on and rock me
You rock me (Only you can rock me)
Come on and rock me (Rock me baby, rock me)
You rock me (Only you can rock me)
Come on and rock me
