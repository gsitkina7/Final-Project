I lost my heart to infatuation
You can't cure that with a vaccination
Bad blood is pumping through my veins
I can't slow down livin' life in the fast lane
Your body language, it's telepathic
I'm caught up in the middle of a two-way traffic
Wondering if this is the impossible dream
Or whether we could make such a beautiful team
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love
Intoxicated 'till I can't feel a thing
I feed my thirst on your unchained adrenaline
Your body's shakin' like a man on the run
You blow my mind like sex and machine guns
I got scars and bloody knucklesd
Diggin' for a diamond in a whole lotta trouble
You detonate me like a nuclear bomb
Wiped out and sleepin' with the TV on
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than.....
Love is love, it ain't always right
Make you sweat, keep you up all night
Walkin' in with your eyes wide open
You're looking out on a lost horizon
Always something to knock you over
And make you feel like you're getting nowhere
If you can't stand up when you're on your knees
Then close your eyes and float up to the breeze
I've lost my heart but hey you can keep it
Cause it ain't no good at keeping a secret
It's got me doing things that I'd never do
Another fine mess that it's gotten me in to
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is, I don't know what it is
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love
