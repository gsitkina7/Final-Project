We were born to rule
Masters of all the universe
For we are the kings of the world
I've played the fool
Broke every rule
Through thick and thin
I've played to win
Against the odds
I fought the gods
And right or wrong
I still stand strong
I count the cost
Of what is lost
When you're under attack
If you never look back
I've been knocked to the floor
But I've come back for more
We were born to rule the earth
Defenders of the universe
Keepers of the flame forevermore
We will fight for what is worth
Cause we were born to rule the earth
Victory is ours to taste
Protectors of the human race
We're the kings of the world
I've felt brave
To play the game
But I stood tall
And gave it all
I count the cost
Of what is lost
When you're under attack
If you never look back
I've been knocked to the floor
But I've come back for more
We were born to rule the earth
Defenders of the universe
Keepers of the flame forevermore
We will fight for what is worth
Cause we were born to rule the earth
Victory is ours to taste
Protectors of the human race
We're the kings of the world
Greater than the seven seas
Mightier than Hercules
We will battle till the fight is won
Our time will come
Again and again and again and again
We were born to rule the earth
Defenders of the universe
Keepers of the flame forevermore
We will fight for what is worth
Cause we were born to rule the earth
Victory is ours to taste
Protectors of the human race
We're the kings of the world
We're the kings of the world
We're the kings of the world
We're the kings of the world
