You ask me to be your savior
But I'm the poster boy for bad behavior
I'm on the edge it's a long way down
Living out loud at the speed of sound
I can hear you calling out my name
You tell me that fate is calling
'cos all you see is darkness falling
Don't let go don't lose your grip
Fire and ice at your fingertips
Can't you hear me calling out for more?
You knock me out like a wrecking crew
I'm back on my feet and all over you
Faster than I've ever been before
I'm on an all time high
Never giving up never giving up
Never gonna die
I'm on an all time high
You gimme the wings
You gimme the reason to fly
Shine your light and I will find you
Follow me I'm right behind you
This is the lifeblood on which I feed
Take what you want I got all I need
There ain't no mountain I can't climb
I once was knee deep in the mud
Lifeless and waiting for the flood
But now my heart is bursting at the seams
And I will not go quietly
No I will not go quietly
