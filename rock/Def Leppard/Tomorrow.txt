Whoo whoo whoo
Whoo whoo whoo
Whoo whoo whoo
Whoo whoo whoo

I'm here to testify
I can't remember why
Complete or justify my situation
I don't remember when
And I can only half pretend
A case of now and then
I just need someone
No solution, there's a saner revolution
There's no better way but there's the only way, lead the way

I wanto to break down, I'm going to shake down
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes
I want to take a ride, I want to kiss the sky
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes

Whoo whoo whoo
Whoo whoo whoo
Whoo whoo whoo
Whoo whoo whoo

Spoke out on compromise, just the ego telling lies
Confides and then defies, in case you're waiting
Guess that it's a time for change
Remain but change the name
This game is where to aim
I hear the charge, boy


It's liberating, but when it rains it pours
Degenerating, ain't going to fight no more

I want break down, I'm going to shake down
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes
I want break down, I'm going to shake down
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes
I want to take a ride, I want to kiss the sky
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes
