I saw you on a screen
An icon, a legend, a king
I heard it in a song
That's still going strong

A shooting star across the sky
You kiss the earth and say goodbye

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Crashing into the sun
Only the good die young
They will always be here
I saw you in a dream
You're falling apart at the seams
I heard it in your voice
That you had no choice
This genius is a heavy load
It leads you down a lonely road
But love never dies


Living inside out
Oh turn this chariot
Like a diamond in the sky
You take me so far away


Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Crashing into the sun
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
