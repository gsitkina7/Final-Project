Hey! Hey! Hey!

I'm back in your face like I've never been away
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm going to stay
Like a runaway mack, like a a union jack
I'm back
Hey! Hey!

I can stand tall, I can stick out a mile
I can come crawling like a hungry reptile
I'm coming around, I'm wired for sound
Shaking it for all it's worth
I'm a spaced-out alien, a techno-sapien
Crashing on down to earth


I can pour your drink, be the perfect host
I can scare the pants off the holiest ghost



Back in the middle, back in the ring
Backing a winner, it's a sure shot thing
Back in your good books, I did you no wrong
Here I am honey, I'm back where I belong
Belong, belong, belong

I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yeah I'm back
You better believe that I'm back
Now let me tell you I'm back
Can't you see that I'm back
Come on and do it, I'm back
There's nothing to it, I'm back
I'm back in your face like I've never been away
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm going to stay
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack
I'm back in your face and don't it feel so good
I'm back in your face and just like I knew that it would
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack
Sheer heart attack and a Jumping jack flash
Like a leader of the pack
And as a matter of fact I'm back
