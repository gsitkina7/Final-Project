Hang on
Yeah
Ha ha ha ha ha
I don't care too much
For your backstabbing and side stepping
You're all sweet talk, you're all lust
You're the kind, yeah, I don't trust
I got to get out, step aside
Before you damage my pride
Let me through don't spoil my view
I got to get away, away from you
Oh no no never thought I'd feel so low
You got me running
You got me running
I ain't going to hide
And yesterday everything seemed okay
Yeah you better run and hide away
Oh you better hide

You're out, out on the street
But I'm back on my feet
I might lose it, so get wise
Stop your using and your lies
Oh my friend don't stick around
Your time is up, the chips are down


You got me running - You got me running
You got me running - You got me running
You got me running - You got me running
You got me running, running, running

You got me running (You got me running)
