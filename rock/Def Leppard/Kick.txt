You're in my head again and I know where it's goin'
I know I'm gonna need another taste of your poison, yeah
You're the pulse to my motor, my electric desire
You're my star blazed rhythm, let me dance in your fire

And I just can't stop it, all night every day
And I just can't stop it and I love it that way

I don't wanna kick, kick, kick your habit
'Cause you never quit, quit, I gotta have it
I don't wanna kick, kick, kick your habit
'Cause you never quit, quit, I gotta have it
Na na na na, na na na, na na na
So won't you gimme some more
I said.. Na na na na, na na na, na na na
So won't you gimme some more
Ah, kick it

You're racing through my brain like a bolt of white lightnin'
And I can't sleep it off 'cause уour love's always strikin'
You'rе the tonic to my thirst, sweet nectar of sin
I keep runnin' away but you keep draggin' me in

And I just can't stop it, all night еvery day
And I just can't stop it and I love it that way

I don't wanna kick, kick, kick your habit
'Cause you never quit, quit, I gotta have it
I don't wanna kick, kick, kick your habit
'Cause you never quit, quit, I gotta have it

Na na na na, na na na, na na na
So won't you gimme some more
I said.. Na na na na, na na na, na na na
So won't you gimme some more
Ah, kick it

I don't wanna kick, kick, kick your habit
'Cause you never quit, quit, I gotta have it
I don't wanna kick, kick, kick your habit
'Cause you never quit, quit, I gotta have it

Na na na na, na na na, na na na
So won't you gimme some more
I said.. Na na na na, na na na, na na na
So won't you gimme some more
Ah, kick it
