You're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
You're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
Let me take you by the hand, I gotta tell you "wow I can"
If it's a dream, I keep dreamin' of the false light start us from above
You got me hooked and I stand the show, she's got me tight and I won't let go
If I ever get to where I'm gonna go to make I feel sure that you end up knowin'
You make you feel somebody, you're a perfect girl
I know I'd never find another if I look'd around the world
Baby you got it going on and you've got a scary damn
I've got your pieces down to tell 'cause I found my perfect girl
Baby you're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
You're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
Sun in the sky would refuse to shine
That wouldn't be enough to get you out of my mind
Paradise that's plain to see you
I love everything so naturally
Your beauty lives and never dies
And living through found my reason why
If I ever get to where I'm going gonna to make
I feel sure that you end up knowin'
You make you feel somebody, you're the perfect girl
I know I'd never find another if I look'd around the world
And you got it going on and you got a scary damn
I've got your pieces down to tell 'cause I found my perfect girl
Baby you're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
I only think about you, whenever I am breathing
I only think about you, all day and every night
I'm never sad about you, oh it's all every day
I Wanna wrap my arms 'round ya I'm so glad that I found you
You don't make me feel somebody 'cause you're the perfect girl
You make you feel somebody, you're a perfect girl
I know I'd never find another if I look'd around the world
Baby you got it going on and you got a scary damn
I've got no reason to keep dreamin' 'cause I found a perfect girl
You're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
You're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
You're the perfect, the perfect, you're the perfect girl
