Come on in, welcome, enter
We've got your front row center
For the freak show parade
Everybody want's to be you
But I know you see right through the sad mascaraed
You wrap your arms around me like a wire
You reach into my soul, pull out the fire

When I come undone I know you're the only one
Who could touch me when I call out your name
When I come undone I know you're the only one
Who could put me back together again
You've got what it takes to make me
So won't you come and shake me out of this haze
All to know those dreams you're selling
God knows, man, he's not telling
He's had better days
I wait to hear a voice above me calling
You dragged me to my knees but I'm still falling


I can't close my eyes, can't hide the tear
I feel the earth beneath my feet disappear
I'm out of words, I'm out of time
Give me your hand, reach out for mine
You wrap your arms around me like a wire
You reach into my soul, pull out the fire
