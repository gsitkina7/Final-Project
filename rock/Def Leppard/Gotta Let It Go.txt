All or nothing women take it all away
In for the kill, there's blood on the water
Its flowing your way now
I don't know nothing
But I know its a long way down
The king of the hill, you reach for the sky
You're losing your crown
You tell it to the one
You tell it to the sun
You tell it to the friends who come and gone
You tell it to the yourself yeah yeah again and again
Got to let it go
Got to let it go
Yeah, you run away
Got to let it go
Got to let it go
You run away, let it go

You came out of nothing
Crawling out of history
The man of the hour
You done the time you hold the key
And there was something
Something just beyond your reach
The bigger the prize, the more you desire
The less you can feel
You do it for yourself
There's really no one else
Another empty picture on the shelf
You're hanging all alone
Yeah, again and again


All you wanted, all you needed, all you got and
