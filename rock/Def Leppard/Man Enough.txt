You got this reputation for calling all the shots
I got your invitation so show me what you got
Are you man enough?
You got me in a cold sweat with a lingering caress
A bullet in your chamber with no return address
If you can keep a secret then we can make a deal
Put your finger on your trigger and show me how you feel
When you’re moving to the music you got voodoo in your hips
And the devil would approve it so the question on my lips
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
To be mine
To be mine
Be my girl
You got my full attention when you’re movin’ ‘cross the floor
Divine intervention comes a knockin’ on my door
I got no time for talking, just need some company
Let your fingers do the walking all over me
When you’re moving to the music you got voodoo in your eyes
Let the devil try to prove it but the question will arise
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
To be mine
To be mine
Be my girl
Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough to be my girl?
Are you man enough? (Are you man enough?)
Are you man enough? (Are you man enough?)
Are you man enough? (Are you man enough?)
To be mine
To be mine
Be my girl
