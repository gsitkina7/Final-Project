I heard this line one time about trying to save the world
Have you ever tried to save yourself?
A wide eyed suicide drive remains a fake
As if you'd ever, ever go and make the same mistake
Strung out as the night comes crawling
Your halo of thorns is falling

Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones
But you don't know your time is up
Blood runs cold
Somebody somewhere is screaming out the words
Do they ever really ease the pain?
I guess what I'm trying to say is whose life is it anyway
Because living, living is the best revenge you can play
This fall from grace, I see your face it's over


From you love was kind
Resolved left scarred and blind
Wasted and naked in the wings
Denying twist of fate
Demanding heaven's gate
Lying in wait above the wind
Strung out as the night comes crawling
Your halo of thorns is falling

Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones
But you don't know your time is up
Blood runs cold
Blood runs cold
Blood runs cold
