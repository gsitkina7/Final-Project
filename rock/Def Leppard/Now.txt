I want to know you better
Let's spend some time together
I want to be what's on your mind
Look in my eyes, they're calling
I need your love to fall in
If you could just give me a sign
I can't get over baby
I can't get over now
I can't get over this feeling I feel
Now, right now
If the fire inside you
Feels like I feel now
Right now
Deep inside of me
Deep inside of me

I'm tired of make believing
I'm lost and barely breathing
I'm on the ceiling, help me down, yeah, yeah
So stop my heart from aching
I'll be the risk you're taking
And I won't rest until you're mine, oh
I want to show you baby
I want to show you now
I want to tell you this feeling I feel

Now, right now
If the fire inside you
Feels like I feel now
Right now
If it's love you're craving
It's a love worth saving
Can't get over this feeling I feel now, yeah

Now, right now
Let the fire inside you
Burn like I do
Now, right now
If there's a love you're craving
It's a love worth saving

Deep inside of me
Deep inside, deep inside of me
Deep inside, deep inside of me
Deep inside of me
Deep inside
