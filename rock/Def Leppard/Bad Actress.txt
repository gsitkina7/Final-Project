Twenty-one years and you answer the call
Hollywood screams from your bedroom wall
You can't get away from the thrill of it all

Bye-bye baby
Get me out of here I'm done
A girl gone crazy
You ain't fooling anyone
You can't sing can't dance
Can't fit in your pants
You're a bad actress
You can't run, can't walk, got to learn how to talk
You're a bad actress
Come on down and walk the moonlit mile
You've got the perfect teeth
You've got the perfect smile
You do it all wrong but you do it in style
Oh yeah


You can't read, can't write
Got to learn how to fight
You're a bad actress
You're too cold, too old
And the story's been told about
The bad actress


You can't run, can't walk
Got to learn how to talk
You're a bad actress
You can't read, can't write
Got to learn how to fight
You're a bad actress
You're too cold, too old
And the story's been told about
The the bad actress
Oh Yeah
Bad actress
Oooh
Bad actress
No good
Bad actress
Too bad
What's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this?
