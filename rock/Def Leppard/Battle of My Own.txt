Darkness falling
Midnight calling
It's a full moon warning
Devil's dawning
Gotta get myself
Back home
Down amongst
The dust and bones
I gotta heart that
Slashed and torn
I need a soul
To be reborn again
Forever is only a kiss away
Just close your eyes and be free
I gotta battle of my own
Dead man walking
He's double talking
Lovers dreaming
But they
Wake up screaming
Night time
It just won't wait
So learn to love
The things you hate
It's like a deadly deja vu
And it could be the
Death of you again
Is this a leap of faith
Or just a fall from grace?
Because I feel no pain
And I feel no shame
Is this the sound
Of a madman
Or just a good man
Gone insane?
And my demons
Lie sleeping
Till my dreams come
Creeping in
Again and again
