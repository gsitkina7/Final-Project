Oh, what a night
I couldn't feel better
I don't know just where to begin
You read me like a book
Right down to the letters
Written all over your skin
It's funny what love will make you do
It's more than just the call of the wild (Ooh-la-la-la)
You know it's that pout
That makes me wanna shout out loud
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh) Oh yeah
Gimme a kiss that rocks
Plunder my skin
Be the tick for my tock
Show me a thrill that shocks
When the thunder begins
Gimme a kiss that rocks
Oh, what a thrill
It's no bitter pill
A taste that makes me shiver and shake
You got that touch of class
With no strings attached
So show me all the magic you make
It's funny what lust will do to you
It's more than just a moth to a flame (Ooh-la-la-la)
You know it's that dream
That makes me wanna scream out loud
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh) Oh yeah
Gimme a kiss that rocks
Sonic boom bang
Be the yin to my yang
Show me a thrill that shocks
When the thunder begins
Gimme a kiss that rocks
I want a real kiss
Don't want just any kiss
One that I just can't resist
So kiss this
Gimme a kiss that rocks
Plunder my skin
Be the tick for my tock
Show me a thrill that shocks
When the thunder begins
Gimme a kiss that rocks
Knock on my door
Gimme four to the floor
Show me a thrill that shocks
When the thunder begins
Gimme a kiss that rocks
