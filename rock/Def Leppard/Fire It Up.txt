Fire it up
Fire it up
Fire it up

Born to raise hell since I lost my heaven
Couldn't find nine, kid, I'm on cloud seven
Cherry top lover with a chemical metal
Heater on high like a pot on kettle
Jukebox gospel, raise it up another level
Young street apostles with their hallelujah peddles
Preachers in the bleachers keep on dancin' with the devil
Swingin' with the king like an Elvis made of velvet
Bring the beat beat back
Bring the beat beat back (Woah-oh-oh)
Let me see you light, spark the dynamite, here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, you gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, blaze on

Nuclear radio, kiss the devastation
Cradle to the stadium, burnin' on the pavement
Fishin' for religion on a mission salvation
History's the soundtrack, wake your generation

Bring the beat beat back
Bring the beat beat back (Woah-oh-oh)
Let me see you light, spark the dynamite, here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, you gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till the damage is done, blaze on
High, high, higher
High, high, higher
High, high, higher
High, high, higher
High, high, higher
High, high, higher

Let me see you light, spark the dynamite, here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till the damage is done, blaze on

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, you gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till the damage is done, blaze on

Blaze on
Blaze on
