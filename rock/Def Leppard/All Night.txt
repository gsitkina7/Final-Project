I like a woman who loves to drive
Loves to do it fast, yeah, above 95
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh yeah
I love a woman who likes to make me sweat
Who'll come on round looking for love, get what she can get
Show me babe what's on your mind
I want to feel you one more time

All night, I like it, all night
I want love, oh, yeah
I want to make love, baby, oh, yeah
I want to make love, child
All night, I want to do it
All night, oh give me love baby
All night, I want to have you
All night, I want to taste you

Come on baby it's showtime
Give it to me, give it to me
I like a woman who wants to be the star
She'll make a man go further than he's ever been before
(Give it to me)
Show me babe what's on your mind
I want to feel you one more time

All night, I like it, all night
I want it (give it to me)
Oh, ah, make a little love, baby
Oh, ah, make a little love, child


You shouldn't want to do
What you wouldn't want me to
You didn't say you wouldn't
And you shouldn't but you do
Let's get personal, give it to me
Oh baby, it's showtime, give it to me
Give me baby, give it to me
Oh I like that, give it to me
Give it to me baby
Don't think, don't think
Don't think, just do it, do it, do it
Oh, ah, make a little love, baby
Oh, ah, make a little love, child

All night, I want to do it
All night, oh give a little love baby
All night, I want to have you
All night

Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
I want to do it
All night, oh give me love baby
All night, I want to have ya
All night, I want to taste you
