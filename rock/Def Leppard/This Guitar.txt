At seventeen
I hadn't seen
The thing that makes us real
Then I found you
At twenty-four
I wanted more
When no one else would listen
You sang to me
You're my shoulder to cry on
You're the best of best friends
You brought fire to my fingers
And brought joy to no end
My brother, my sister
My lover, my wife
It's crazy I know
But this guitar saved my life
Broken down, border town
Feels like the end of time
Without you
You came to me
And made me see
Caress me with your honesty endlessly
You're my shoulder to cry on
You're the best of best friends
You brought fire to my fingers
And brought joy to no end
My brother, my sister
My lover, my wife
It's crazy I know
But this guitar saved my life
Me with you, you with me
The ghosts all disappear
Naturally
You lay to rest
My emptiness
And show the world your beauty
Through me
You're my shoulder to cry on
You're the best of best friends
You brought fire to my fingers
You brought joy to no end
My brother, my sister
My lover, my wife
It's crazy I know
But this guitar
This guitar saved my life
