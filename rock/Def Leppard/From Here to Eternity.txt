Can't you see
There's a hole where my heart used to be?
Set me free
From here to eternity
Do you still hear me
When I call your name?
My constant companions
Are heartache and shame
Now there's a good reason
They're one and the same
I pulled out my gun
You had nowhere to run
As I watched you get shot down in flames
Yes, it's true
I did what I did for you
Can't you see
There's a hole where my heart used to be?
Set me free
From here to eternity
The devil may take me
But you're not to blame
Just a fatal attraction
That I can't explain
So, lord give me shelter
From out of the rain
There's no sideways glances
I'm all out of chances
They're coming to take me away
Yes, it's true
But what more could I do for you?
Can't you see
There's a hole where my heart used to be?
Set me free
From here to eternity
As we walk into the dark and slam the door
Our souls are entwined forevermore
Broken to the core
Can't you see (Can't you see baby?)
There's a hole where my heart used to be? (Yeah, yeah)
Set me free (Set me free, baby)
From here to eternity (Oh-oh)
