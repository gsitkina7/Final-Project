Faces on the ceiling
Writing's on the wall
No one to believe in
And nowhere left to fall
The road ahead gets longer
Like a land from outer space
I can't get much stronger
Lost without a trace
Desolation is all I see
Liberation is what I need
Desperation is following me
If only I could feel like I'm gonna be
Touched by the wings of an angel
Touched by the wings of an angel
Gabriel lay your hands on me
And now the voice of reason
Has nothing left to say
There's rebels in the kingdom
As heaven looks away
If only you could hear me
If you could see the darkness fall
But your spirit walks right through me
Like a shadow on my soul
Touch me touch me please
