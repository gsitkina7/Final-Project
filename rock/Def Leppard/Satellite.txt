Midnight, bright light, shining from the sky
Circulating around the earth, trying to catch your eye
Lowdown, showdown, trying to break away
Stay on course, feel the force, careful what you say

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah can't you feel that it's real?
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah set your sights on the satellite

Me and you, rendezvous, we've got to take the chance
I'm paralyzed, I'm hypnotized, I'm in some kinda trance
Hazy, crazy, this thing's lost control
It's got the power, it's got the strength to steal away your soul

It's burning up the sky
It's burning up the sky
Yes it's burning, yes it's burning
Can't you see that it's burning
Can't you see that it's burning
It's burning up the sky
Can't you see that it's burning
