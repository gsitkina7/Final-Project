It's a slow news day
But it's gonna happen anyway
Lock it up and lose the key
A truth we'll never see
Is just thrown away
And hidden from us everyday
A secret that just has to be
Is buried on page thirty three
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it break you down
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it break you
Another deadline lost
Another promise gone at any cost
You can't see the damage done
A battle never won
If only you could see
Your fingerprints all over me
Savaged by your poison hand
Your wishes never my command
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it break you down
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it brеak you
Angels can't help you now
Therе's no time to reason why
Angels can't help you now
And it's too late to even try
Angels can't help you now
And with the touch of your hand
You cast your shadow over the sun
And now it's done
Angels can't help you now
There's no time to reason why
Angels can't help you now
And it's too late to even try
Angels can't help you now
'Cause with the touch of your hand
You cast your shadow over the sun
Angels can't help you now
There's no time to turn around
Angels can't help you now
'Cause it's such a long way down
Angels can't help you now
And in the palm of my hand
The one thing that can still make me feel
The one thing with the power to heal
There's a crack in the sky
So say your goodbyes
Welcome to the end of the end
