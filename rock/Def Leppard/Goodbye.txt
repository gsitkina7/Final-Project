I've been waiting, going crazy
I can't sleep when I know you're not around
I've been saving what you're craving
Look at my face I'm about to replace
Every hurt, every tear that you cry

Because when you feel this strong and you can't go on
There's nothing wrong, just try to realize
You won't ever have to say goodbye
You won't ever have to say, "I've wasted all my time"
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems just look into my eyes
You won't ever have to say goodbye
I'm just praying, hear me saying
I'd be there if the sun refused to shine
As the night gets colder I will be your shoulder
I give you my heart until death us do part
Every day, every moment, forever
