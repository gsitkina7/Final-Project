You're a voice on the street
You're the faces that I meet
All day my life is keeping time
Time with your heartbeat
Time with your heartbeat every day
It's no use to run and hide
You'll be running running running by my side
All day my life is keeping time
Time with your heartbeat
Time with your heartbeat every day
Like children we have laughed
And played the game you and me
But have you seen me cry?
Once I believe I saw you dying yet you still remain
To me the same mystery
Only closer
Much closer to my heart
And so you see
I couldn't let you
Leave me be
All day my life is keeping time
Time with your heartbeat
Time with your heartbeat every day
All day my life...ahhh...
Is keeping time
Time with your heartbeat
Time with your heartbeat every day
