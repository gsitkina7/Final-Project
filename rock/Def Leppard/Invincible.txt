Just like the movies
When the hero never dies
I am immortal
When you look into my eyes
A lead role in a gilded cage
I could take the centre stage
Bruised hearts are broken
When love is at the door
I bet your tears dried up
Before they hit the floor
I'm gonna take a guilt trop
But I promise be back soon
You wake up screaming
When I leave the room
I am invincible
'Cos my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible
You keep on moving
Running from your perfect past
Hiding in your broken dreams
Was never gonna last
A love looking for a sign
A shiver looking for a spine
Never let that feeling slip away
I am invincible
'Cos my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible
I am invincible
'Cos my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible
