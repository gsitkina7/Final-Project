Oooh I love you, baby
I love you night and day
When I leave you, baby, don't cry the night away
When I die, don't you write no words upon my tomb
I don't believe I want to leave
No epitaph of doom
Ooh ooh ooh - when I'm dead and gone
I wanna leave some happy woman living on
Ooh ooh ooh - when I'm dead and gone
Don't want nobody to mourn
Beside my grave, yeah
Old Mama Linda
She's out to get my hide
She's got a shotgun and her daughter by her side
Hey there, ladies
John son's free
Who's got the love, who's got enough
To keep a man like me
Ooh ooh ooh - when I'm dead and gone
I wanna leave some happy woman living on
Ooh ooh ooh - when I'm dead and gone
Don't want nobody to mourn
Beside my grave, yeah
