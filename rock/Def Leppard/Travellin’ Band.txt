737 coming out of the sky
Oh, won't you take me down
To Memphis on a midnight ride?
I want to move
Playing in a travellin' band, ee, ya
Well, I'm flying across land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travellin' band
Take me to the hotel baggage car
No where, come on, come on
Won't you get me to my room?
I want to move
Playing in a travellin' band, ee, ya
Well, I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travellin' band
Listen to the radio talking
About the last show
Someone got excited
Had to call the state militia
I want to move
Playing in a travellin' band, ee, ya
Well, I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travellin' band, oh, wow
Hell will come again on a Saturday night
Oh, with your fussing and your fighting
Won't you get me to the right?
I want to move
Playing in a travellin' band, ee, ya
Well, I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travellin' band, oh, wow
Oh, I'm playing in a travellin' band
Playing in a travellin' band
Won't you get me, take me hand?
Well, I'm playing in a travellin' band
Well, I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travellin' band, oh, wow
Hey
