Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock 'n' roll
I move like a cat
Talk like a rat
Sting like a bee
Oh babe, I wanna be your man
Well it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th century boy
Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock 'n' roll
I fly like a plane
Drive like a car
Ball like a hound
Oh babe, I wanna be your man
Well it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th century boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock 'n' roll
I move like a cat
Talk like a rat
Sting like a bee
Oh babe, I'm gonna be your man
Well it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah I'm your toy
Your 20th century boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
