Blinded by a bright beam
Shattered by the windscreen
Stunned by the whiplash
I'm a victim of a bad crash

I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
Oh, my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down

Bleedin' by a blind bend
Wrong way up a dead end
Screamin' through a speed trap
As I tear into a tailback

You know
I can do nothing right
No, I, I never sleep at night
And I can't even start a fight
Well, my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' 'round and 'round

Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Yeah, keeps a-tumbling down
Come on, slide
I'm slipping down

I got my hands in the fire

Ooh, I'm sliding on an oil slick
Burnin' on a bad trip
Yes, and nothing's gonna change it

No, I can do nothing right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinnin' 'round and 'round

Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
No, no
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down, yeah
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
