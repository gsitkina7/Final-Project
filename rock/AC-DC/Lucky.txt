(Ooh, wah, wah)
(Ooh, wah, wah)

L-U-C-K-Y, baby, come on
Pussy on fire
You are so lucky tonight
Because I give you the show you want
L-U-C-K-Y, honey, honey
A little bit of twisting and sliding
You are so lucky tonight
Because I give you the show you want
Wake up girls now is the time to listen
Hand on hip and assume the position
Mama Ru said we were all born naked
Gottmik says: "love your body, don't pretend it"
Here's the tea I put to work, baby
So fight for yourself and let all the basic enemies hide, baby
This face stamped so well
Clown paint and waist so tight
Boys, girls and in between
It's time to crown your queen, let's go

Yo, the Muse is back
Top four, bitch, on the track
He 'bout brought it back
And you hoes better look at your back
Queens want to have my place
They said I would go first
Now I laugh from the top (Ha ha ha ha!)
From the hood to Hollywood
With three bad bitches on my side
Number one showstopping diva
Now I am ready for my crown, bitch

Was, had to get your attention, which was not difficult
Now I just need to mention that you are
L-U-C-K-Y, baby, comes on
Pussy on fire
You are lucky tonight
‘Cause I givin’ you show off that you want
L-U-C-K-Y, honey, honey
A little twist and slip
You are lucky tonight
‘Cause I givin’ you show off that you want

You are so lucky
You are, you are so lucky, lucky
You are so lucky
Y-O-U-R-E so lucky

Little scottish boy grew up high
I am the definition of the American dream
Lucky for my dad who believed in a star
But take it from Judah, you better work to get far
Everything about this bitch is right
Enlarge resume, thick font
Can I rap? What a gag
Check it out baby it's a rap
(Aah) Do you wanna taste me?
(Ahh) I'm a black mother ...
Enchantress, it took a minute, but now I see
(Ahh) I'm sugar honey iced tea
(Ahh) I've got fashion, beauty and mind
Do you see this crown? Oh baby this is for me

You're so lucky
You are so lucky, lucky
You're so lucky
You're so lucky
You are so lucky, lucky
You're so lucky
You're so lucky
You are so lucky, lucky
You're so lucky
You're so lucky
You are so lucky, lucky
You're so lucky
You're so lucky
You are so lucky, lucky
You're so lucky
You're so lucky
You are so lucky, lucky
You're so lucky
