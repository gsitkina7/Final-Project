Breaking out, about to shout
Feel a need for one more round
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite
If you want some trouble, I'm the king of vice
I'm a wrecking ball, I'm a stinging knife
Steal your money, gonna take your life

You got screaming murder, lock up your door
Double dealing, got to have more
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business

Flesh and blood, I'm a rag and bone
A bad luck message on the telephone
Don't you worry, play my game
I'll do you a favor, put your soul for sale
Like a cannonball, goin' down the track
Need good lovin', but I want it back

I was found in trouble, they gave up on me
Teacher preaching what not to be
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell my boys that I'm gonna be


 (x2)

Back in business again (and I'm lookin' for ya)
