Well me and the boys
Are out to have some fun
Gonna put on a show
Come on, let's go

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
Every night, there's a rock 'n' roll queen
Gonna quiver and quake
Gonna shake her thing

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
It's a rock 'n' roll show


We got a big fat sound
Wanna share it round
Got a big bass drum
Gonna have some fun

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

Does that rock, or what?
