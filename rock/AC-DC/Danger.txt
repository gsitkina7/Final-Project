Don't talk to strangers
Keep away from the danger, yeah, yeah
Don't talk to strangers who smile
Keep away from the danger all the time
You just a-keep away

Ow!
Ow!
Just a-keep away, yeah
Ow!
Red lights are flashin'
There's been a misunderstanding, yeah, yeah
I'm bruised, broke and bandaged
Through drinkin' all that brandy, yeah

I was under the table, but I came back for more
Got to hit that bottle, but my head hit the floor

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

Red lights still flashing
People all still dancin' in my head
I'm done with thinkin' about what to do
Another bout of drinkin', just one before I'm through

I was just raising hell, I wasn't doing no harm
The cops could not appreciate my natural charm
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away


Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

Don't you go talkin' to no stranger in this town
