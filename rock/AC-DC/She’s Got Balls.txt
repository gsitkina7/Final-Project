She's got style, that woman
Makes me smile, that woman
She's got spunk, that woman
Funk, that woman
She's got speed, my lady
Got what I need, my baby
She's got the ability, hey
To make a man out of me

But most important of all
Let me tell you
The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls

She's got soul, my lady
Likes to crawl, my baby
All around the floor on her hands and knees
Ooh, because she likes to please me

But most important of all
Let me tell you

The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls


And she's got taste, my lady
Pace, my lady
Makes my heart race
With her pretty face
She's got balls, my lady
Likes to crawl, my lady
Hands and knees all around the floor
No one has to tell her what a feller is for
But let me tell you all

The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls

The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
