In a one-horse town
They try to put you down
And make you feel out of place
Don't dare look in your face

Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Hey, hey
Ooh, yeah
On a hot summer day
Dollar bills come your way
Somebody robbed the bank
Ooh, they picked you outta the ranks
Hey

Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation

(Oh, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
You better keep away
(Oh, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
Don't get in my face
Oh yeah
(Oh, oh yeah)
(Hey, yeah)

And I'm comin' down Main Street
Get out of my way
I ain't stoppin' for nobody
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Wild, yeah

(Oh, yeah) Gotta keep away
(Hey, yeah) I ain't stoppin' for nobody
(Oh, yeah) I've got a wild reputation
(Hey, yeah)
