When I see a pretty woman
You know it give me a thrill
And she's tailor made to order
You know I can't stand still
And you won't need a doctor
'Cause it'll cure all ills
And when I hear a noisy party
You know it give me a chill
It gets me rockin' and a-rollin'
And I can't stand still
From mornin' till midnight
You know I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
You know I can't stand still
I can't stand still
From morning till midnight
You know I can't stand still
Ooh yeah


Well, when it comes to sippin' honey
You know I drink my fill
And I've been dancin' on the water
You know I can't stand still
From mornin' 'till midnight
You know I can't stand still
Ooh yeah
 (x3)
(Thank you, lads
Thank you, lads, thank you!)
