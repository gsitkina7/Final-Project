You learn to sing
You learn to play
Why don't the businessmen ever learn to pay?

That's show business
(Show business)
Show business
(Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes
You play in halls
You play in bars
You're climbing walls
Chasing stars



You pay the man
You pay your dues
When it's all gone
Oh, you sing the blues


You wanna roll
You wanna rock
But you find it hard
If your guitar's in hock


You're smokin' butts
They smoke cigars
You're drowned in debt
They drown in bars


You pull a chick
Take her home
No use, man
You're worn out to the bone
