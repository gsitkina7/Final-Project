Don't you gimme no line
Better run, if you can
Just like a thorn in the side

So, don't gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no lies
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll

Don't you play me no jive
A bit of fun on the side
Can too much crap make you blind

So, don't gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no whine
 (x2)

I said
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

 (x2)
Listen, everybody
Said
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
I said, you can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
