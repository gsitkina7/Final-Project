I like 'em big, and I like 'em small
And if I had to take the oath, I would take them all
Gimme that rough stuff
(It's what I want)

She's a saint, she's a sinner
She's a rave, rave, rave
She's a woman, she's a winner
In every way, way, way
She don't want love
Nor cabaret, that's out
She like to play it wild
That suits me fine
I like it better when she read my mind

You know, don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't wanna play that game

Just gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
You don't want ruff stuff?
Don't want your face around here

Make you shake, make you shiver
Make you pray, pray, pray
Gonna make you quake, make you quiver
And turn you grey, grey, grey

I don't need brakes
They slow me down too much
They keep me out of touch
They lock me out
I like it better when I pull the pin
And I don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't want to play that game



I like them big, and I like 'em small
And if you asked me to take an oath
Why, I would take them all

Gimme that ruff stuff
Gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
Babe, I want ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff, baby
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
I'm takin' all the ruff stuff
I want it, yeah

Don't want your face 'round here, that's it
Don't want your face 'round here
I don't want your face around my backyard any more
I don't
