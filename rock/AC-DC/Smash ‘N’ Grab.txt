Come on and blow your mind
You're outta time
Beat your chest
Join in like all the rest

Shoot 'em up
Hey, hey, hey, yes
Hey hey, hey, yeah
Seems like you ran a mile
Hey, try to unwind
Come on, let's blow your mind
It's no use, you ain't got time

Without a sound
Come on, let's get around
All I get are cries
Come on in, then
And just

Smash, grab and take it
While you can, yeah
Smash, grab and take it
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Why don't you come out?
Come on, run it to the ground
You're gonna blow your mind
You're gonna pulverize

Don't you come up late
You got to pick your stage
It's gonna blow your mind
And all the living day
Smash, grab and take it
Take it for yourself
Smash, grab and take it
Take it, take it, take it, yeah

Ooh, shoot 'em up, yeah
And take it while you can
Come on, let's blow your mind
Hey, hey, hey, yeah


Shoot 'em right down
Take it while you can
Come on let's blow your mind
Smash, grab, take it
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Smash, grab and take it for yourself
Smash, grab and take it
