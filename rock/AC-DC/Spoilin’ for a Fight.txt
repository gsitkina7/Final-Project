I see trouble coming later

Well I'm coming to a boil
Sliding, going rogue
From a lift, come on down
We're going to roll right out
I'm a fighting fool
And I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on the line, yeah
'Bout to take the money
Rock with me
Come on, come on
You're only

Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight, spoiling for a fight, spoiling for a fight

Make your heartbeat thump
And make your starter jump, yeah
You're a rock and rolling time, yeah
And then you're fightin' all night
With my rockin' shoes
'Cause I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on the line
All my life

Rock with me
Come on, come on
You're only
Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight
Trying to make it right
Spoiling for a fight, spoiling for a fight
Trying to make it right


You'd better stand your ground
And keep out of my town
Fight to live another day
Oh yeah
Come on
Step off


Fighting all night
'Cause I'm spoiling for a fight
