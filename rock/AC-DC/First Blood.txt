Got a screaming feeling
Need a little lovin' healing
Want some of that stuff
'Cause I like a hot touch, yeah
Want a little squeezing
Just a touch and teasing
May be wrong, may be right
But I like it every night

Come on, baby
Down my way
Then we'll make it, night and day
I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)

Some like it hot
Some like it quite not so hot
But I like her touch
And I want it so much

Come on, baby
Down my way
We're going to make it every night and day

I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)

I like it hot, hot, hot, hot
I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)
I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)

I wanted first blood
Some like it hot
First blood
Alright, hot shot
Bad dog, he come back for more
I want first blood
