Well, they moved on down
And they crawled around

Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues

And you start to scratch
When they start to hatch
Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues

Ooh, but when they start to bite
Then it's time you saw the light
For an appointment
I know
Before you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
Mulligan


Well, the doctor said
"We got to make 'em dead"

Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues
And when you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
And when they start to itch
You go out and you take the bitch
For an appointment
Well you rub it on
And you rub it in

Stops 'em walkin'
Side-way walkin'
Gives them the blues
Side-way walkin'
Side-way walkin'
They've got the blues
Give them the blues
They got the blues
Give them the blues
