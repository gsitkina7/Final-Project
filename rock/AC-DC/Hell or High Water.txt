Get out my way
D'you hear what I say?

Everybody, you don't have to choose
You don't have to prove
It's only rock 'n' roll

Mama done told me
Papa done scold me
Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table
Don't you sing on me

Mama done told me
Daddy done scold me
Told me, shown me
You know that he showed me

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Blood money, lying through your back teeth
Fighting on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me

Mama done told me
"Poor boy, get home"
Hot living, trigger-happy feeling
Touch him up and tease him
You know it's so bad

Mama done told me
Papa done scold me
Told me, shown me
Rock 'n' rolled me


Come Hell
Hell, Hell, Hell
Give it Hell
