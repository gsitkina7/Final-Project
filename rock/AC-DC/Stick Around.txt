You've been smiling lately baby
You been singing in the bath
You been acting like a lady
Not a dirty photograph

Then tonight you came home early
Packed a bag or two
It's been worrying me, honey
Just what you're going to do
Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around, baby
Stick around

Well, you came on like a hurricane
About a month ago
Blowing like a stiff breeze
Always on the go

All the good times that we had, baby
All stayed in the past
All the good lays that I get
Never seem to last

Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around, baby
Stick around
C'mon, baby, sit on this!

What have I been doing lately
To make you want to go?
I take you out dancing
Honey, we can go out to a show

Spend a night romancing
Nights out on the town
Listen to me, baby
You'll be glad you stuck around

Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around, yeah
Stick around
