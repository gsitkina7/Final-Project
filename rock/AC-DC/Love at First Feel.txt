You never told me where you came from
You never told me your name
I didn't know if you were legal tender
But I'd spend you just the same
And I didn't know it could happen to me
But I fell in love in the first degree

It was love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
First touch was too much, ow
They told me it was disgusting
Told me it was a sin
Oh, saw me knocking on your front door
Saw me smile when you let me in
You and me baby, we's all alone
Let's get something going
While your mom and dad ainâ€™t home

Love at first feel
It was love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Felt good just like I knew it would


(Love at first feel)
It was (love at first feel)
(Love at first feel)
It was (love at first feel)
(Love at first feel) Lightnin' bolts on my fingertips
Love at first feel (love at first feel)
Love (Love at first feel)
(Love at first feel)
(Love at first feel)
