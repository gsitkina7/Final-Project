A little game of falling down
You rock and roll when the call come around
Come on, baby, and mix 'em down
Made in the shade and you wish it'd turn around
You're going to rock, you'll rock the night away
You're going to roll baby, and I'll make the grade
We're going to rock 'round, rockin'-rollin' all in the town
You're going to make it right
We're going to make it rock all night
She gets rock and roll
She likes rock and roll
You want rock and roll
I need rock and roll
Every day
And all through the night

We are a gang coming down
We gonna rock all night
Rock and rolling all the time
She may be home, rolling out the groove
You know that rock and roll's squeezing out the tube



She gets rock and roll
She gets rock and roll
She gets rock and roll
I like rock and roll

I got to dance all night long
And rock into the room, yeah
She likes sugar
And I like honeydew
We've gotten around a bit
I ain't going to mess around with you


We are going to rock around
Rocking rolling all in the town
We are going to make it right
We are going to make it rock all night
We are going to rock around
Rocking rolling all in the town
We are going to make it right
We are going to make it rock all night
