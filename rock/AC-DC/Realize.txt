The moment you realize
Those moments just pass you by
Gonna take you to paradise

Move it
Make you prove it, yeah
Breakin' out
Break it down
Feel the chills, feel the chills
Movin' down your spine
(Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh)
When we recall and
Realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Make you realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I've got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly

Your eye's playin' tricks on you
Your mind will seek the truth
You know you're gonna make it through

I said move it
Makе you prove it
Shake it up, shake it down
Feel thе chills, feel the chills
Movin' down your spine

(Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh)
When we recall and
Realize, hey yeah (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Gonna make you realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I got the power to electrify
Make a play to satisfy
Feel a chill up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
Fly, fly

When we recall and
Realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Gonna make you realize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I got the power to hypnotize
Make a play, mesmerize
Feel the chills up and down your spine
I'm gonna make you fly
