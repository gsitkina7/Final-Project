You wanted love

You wanted love
Dirty, dirty love
Don't want lust
Just a little love

You're like a dream
You're dirty, low and mean

You're sticky, hot and sweet

Need a shot of rhythm and lovin'
You make a black sheep a ram
This ainâ€™t no gun in my pocket
I got the goods in my hand
Yeah
Send for the man

Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
