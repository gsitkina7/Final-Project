I look at my watch to find out
The right time of day
I look at her libido
Hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna get off and come home
And roll her on the hay
Making her sweat, temperature rise
All through the day

Man, it's getting hot, hot, hot
I said, man, it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter
Man, it's getting hot, hot
Gettin' hot around here
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown

I got a feelin' in my bones
I've been racking my brains out
All night long
Stokin' up the fire
Take it right up to the wire
Burning on and on
Burning on
