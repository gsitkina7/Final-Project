Unchained
Feel it burnin' up the heat
See the flames
Scorchin' everything it seeks

We got a chain reaction
It needs immediate action
This furnace is about to blast
Systems (Systems) are going down
Systems are burning out
And they all fall down

Untamed
Like a tiger searchin' feed
Ain't no game
As the earth shakes beneath your feet

We got a plan of action
Rising heat to the maximum
Who knows if this place implodes?

Systems (Systems) are going down
We got a chain reaction
Systems are burning out
And they all fall down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey

This furnace is about to blast

Systems (Systems) are going down
Systems are burning out
And they all fall down
(Systems down)
Overload
(Systems down)
See the flames fly
(Systems down)
Systems goin' down
(Systems down)
Watch it burn to the ground
