Hey, sugar baby
So hot and tasty
Come on, give me some love, you're driving me wild
It's way past midnight
Why don't we take a ride?
We'll make some honey as we're cruisin' real slow, yeah

Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
I'll be your ladies man
If you give me the chance
We keep a-jumping till the music run dry
And if we take a rest
We'll smoke some cigarettes
And start a-smoking, going out of control
And

Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Let's not waste it
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
We're going to make it

Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Let's not waste it
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
We're going to make it
Let's go

Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
