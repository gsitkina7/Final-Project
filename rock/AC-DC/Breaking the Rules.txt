Black sheep and a renegade
Hot feet in the cool of the shade
Street jungle in the tough-child 'hoods
Examinations done no good
Ghetto bars and hot wired cars
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars
No rebellion, not today

I get my kicks in my own way
Right, okay
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule

Tough breaks in the neighborhood
A hard case who's up to no good
Living like trash, a society rash
Ready to break, and ready to dash
A bad deal and a real rough ride
And doing time on the other side
No rebellion, not today

I get my kicks in my own way
Right, okay

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Tough breaks
They got regulation ties
Regulation shoes
Those regulation fools
With their regulation rules

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules (Breaking the rules)
Get ready
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready, get ready, get ready
Ready to rule

Oh, take off your ties
And your regulation shoes
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools, yeah
And your damn regulation rules
I'm gonna do things my own way
Every day, every day, every day in every way
I ain't gonna pay no attention to your rules
