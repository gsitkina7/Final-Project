So long ago, has it been that long
Since we felt the sun
Where has it gone to
Has it hid from the world
Have we lost our way
I can remember it filling the sky
And it would warm my face
The summers were endless
But they are over now
That was yesterday
I know we will find love again
If we all pray a little
The heart will break free
Beyond the clouds
That is where my soul waits
She is waiting now
Beyond the clouds

Sorrow seems endless
Now there is only so much
That a man can bear
Hold on so tender
To a glimmer of faith
Gets me half way there
I know it will shine again
With some prayer and some patience
We will find our way home

Beyond the clouds
That is where my soul waits
She is waiting now
Just beyond

Beyond anything you have ever known
Oh, so beautiful
Like a summer sky
Oh, you know it will not be long
If we find the strength I know
There beyond the clouds
We will find the sun
Beyond the clouds
That is where my soul waits, oh yeah
She is waiting now
Beyond

Beyond the clouds
That is where my love waits
She is waiting now
Beyond the clouds

Yeah, that is it now, ooh
Oh, that is it now, baby, ooh
Beyond everything you have ever known
Oh, if I could find the strength, I know
We will find the sun
