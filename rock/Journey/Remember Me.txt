Remember me... remember me...
Find myself all alone in darkness without you
Now I can't turn away from what I must do
You know I'd give my life for you
More than words can say
I've shown you how to love someone
I know you'll find a way
Say goodbye, close your eyes - remember me
Walk away, the song remains - remember me
I'll live forth somewhere in your heart
You must believe - remember me
No way I can change my mind
I don't have the answers
If you could see through my eyes
You'd let go of your fears
And though I have to leave you now
We are part of each other
I'll miss your touch, you'll call my name
I am with you forever
Say goodbye, close your eyes - remember me
Walk away, the song remains - remember me
Winds of change we can't expain - remember me
I'll live forth somewhere in your heart
You must believe - remember me
You know I'd give my life for you
More than words can say
I've shown you how to love someone
I know you'll find the way
Say goodbye, close your eyes - remember me
Walk away, the song remains - remember me
Be there to watch over you - remember me
Feel I'm gone, my heart lives on - remember me
Don't you think of this as the end
I'll come in through your dreams - remember me
Close your eyes - remember me
Say goodbye - remember me
Say you will - say you will - say you will...
Close your eyes - remember me
Say you will - say you will - say you will...
Say goodbye - remember me...
