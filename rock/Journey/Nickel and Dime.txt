Mountain of mystery, rising high above the clouds
Mountain of magic, standing tall and proud
Your magical veins flowing silver and gold
Your cumulus cloud glows misty red
As Apollo sets beyond your head
Releasing the pressure built over the years
The mountain is crying hot lava tears
Molten rock created under
Vibrations of subterranean thunder
Ejecting boulders like pieces of sand
The mountain is giving birth to the land
Under your feet, you feel a rumble
As thousands of rocks are starting to tumble
Above the trees where the buzzard flies
Swirling vapors begin to rise
Beneath those misty peaks you hide
A tremendous force boiling deep inside
