I know you got that special something, oh, baby
I know you like to keep it humming, oh, baby
Because girl, loving you is so easy
Oh, woh, woh. Loving you is so easy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on girl, give me that good loving, oh baby
Come on girl, keep the motor humming, oh, woh, baby
Because loving you is so easy
My, my, my, my
Loving you is easy
Girl, after the morning sunlight
After the band has flown away
Oh, we'll be thinking of you
Yes, we'll be holding on girl
Loving you is easy.
Oh, I'm loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, you
Oh, and it's easy (easy)
Oh, I'm loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, you
Oh, and it's easy (easy)
