Many days have faded away and the time has passed
Those were memories that have been by so fast
I can't see you
I can't hear you
But I feel you

I would find you
I would find you
Well, I would find you
I would find you

Now that we know that we've been there and the time is running out
That message was from the Lord without a doubt
I can't see you
I can't hear you
But I feel you
Could it be that I feel so all alone
It's you that's driving me mad
You won't leave me alone
You have touched
