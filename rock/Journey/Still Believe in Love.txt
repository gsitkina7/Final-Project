Too many living lonely
Without a love of their own
Their hearts close the door
Choose to avoid surrender
Choose to go it all alone
Missing so much more
I still believe in love (Still believe in love)
I still believe in real romance
Believe that there’s a someone
For everyone
Waiting to take a chance
I still believe one kiss (Still believe one kiss)
Could be enough to change your life
Believe it’s in one touch
I still believe in love (I still believe, I still believe)
(I still believe in love)
I still believe in love
Some run from the promise
Never give up control
It’s a sign of the times
True hearts know the answer
In their sacred space they shine
Ooh, commitment’s not a crime
I still believe in love (Still believe in love)
I still believe in real romance
Believe that there’s a someone
For everyone
Waiting to take a chance
I still believe one kiss (Still believe one kiss)
Could be enough to change your life
Believe it’s in one touch
I still believe in love (I still believe, I still believe)
(I still believe in love)
I still believe in love (Still believe in love)
I still believe in real romance
Believe that there’s a someone
For everyone
Waiting to take a chance
I still believe one kiss (Still believe one kiss)
Could be enough to change your life
Believe it’s in one touch
I still believe in love (I still believe, I still believe)
(I still believe in love)
Too many livin’ lonely
Without a love of their own
Too many livin’ lonely
I still believe in love
Oh, still believe in love
