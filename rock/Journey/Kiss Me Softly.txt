There's a state of grace that happens every day
It's a feeling I thought lost or locked away
Another question to an answer that I know
Oh, are you coming home, coming home for sure
I'd walk a thousand miles, just to hear you calling
Out my name

Kiss me softly kiss me slowly
I get lost in you like only lovers do
Hold me closer love me tender
I get swept away like only lovers do
You've awakened something deep inside my soul
And every moment, every breath I feel it more
Your hidden treasure that you keep down
Deep inside
We make love freely as we watch the new sunrise
I'd live a thousand lives if every one I lived could
Be with you

I'd live a thousand lives
If every one I lived could be with you


Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do
