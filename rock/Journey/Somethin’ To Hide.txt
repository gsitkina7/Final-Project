Please come talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
You say there's nothing wrong
I know
It's been a long long time
Since I last saw your face
Traces in my mind, I know
You've got something to hide
That you're not telling me
You got something to hide
And I know
Well there's something about you and I know
That you're not telling me
