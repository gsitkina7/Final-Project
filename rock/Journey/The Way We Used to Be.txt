Not seeing your face
I miss being close
But it's your touch, babe
I miss the most
Feeling the distance
In our sacred space
Baby never thought we'd be
We'd be in this place

Can we ever get back?
To the way we were doing it
To the way we were livin' it
Back to the way we used to be
Need a way to get back
To the way we were lovin' it
To the way we were livin' it
Back to the way wе used to be
What's it gonna look like?
For mе and you
Facing the changes
The end of all that we knew?
We're in this together
It's about what we choose
Our fears we have got to let go
As long as there's me and you

Can we ever get back?
To the way we were doin' it
To the way we were livin' it
Back to the way we used to be
Need a way to get back
To the way we were lovin' it
To the way we were livin' it
Back to the way we used to be

Back to the way we used to be
The way we were livin' it
The way we were lovin'
Back to the way we used to be
The way we were livin' it
The way we were lovin' it
Can we ever get back?
To the way we were doin' it
To the way we were livin' it
Back to the way we used to be
Need a way to get back
To the way we were lovin' it
To the way we were livin' it
Back to the way we used to be

Back to the way we used to be
Back to the way we used to be
