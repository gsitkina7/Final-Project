Kids hanging out on a Saturday night
Waiting on wheels, want to go for a ride
Cruising 'round town, just feels right
Got to get away
Blasting rock and hip hop, they know
All dressed down with no place to go
A difficult age just taking it slow
Wait for better days
Cannot stop the wild and restless
Still the ritual goes on
Following the footsteps
Where their fathers used to run
Turn around and face the change
Young hearts all beat the same
The fire in the soul remains
Ooh, in every generation
Young rebels have their time
Glory days are going to shine
Ooh, there's a brand new face waiting right behind
Every generation

Fashions go and come back around
And vinyl LPs still got a cool sound
Flash back to retro (retro)
It's all new again
Fighting wars under different names
Losing daughters and sons, we all feel the pain
Through the tears, why don't things ever change
Between now and then
While the radio's still playing
That familiar sweet love song
We still share the same desire
We all need to belong

Turn around and face the change
Young hearts all beat the same
The fire in the soul remains
Ooh in every generation
Young rebels have their time
Glory days are going to shine
Ooh there's a brand new face waiting right behind
Every generation
Some generations leave us heroes of their day
With magic moments that still take our breaths away
Some will inherit all the politics and blame
And some will leave this world a better place

Turn around and face the change
Young hearts all beat the same
The fire in the soul remains
Ooh in every generation
Young rebels have their time
Glory days are going to shine
Ooh there's a brand new face waiting right behind
Every generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Every generation
They keep coming around
Every generation
Na na na na na
Yeah
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
