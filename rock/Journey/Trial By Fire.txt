Treasures in the jars of clay
Let the light shine out of darkness
Fallen down but not destroyed
It's just another trial by fire
In my song I'll send a prayer
Do you know me, do you hear me
Where the will to face this shame
It's just another trial by fire
Hello Mr. Moon
Can I have some time with you
Trouble keep me running
You can see it coming
I know who shines down on you
Hello Mr. Moon
I've come back to talk to you
All my life I'm running
From the love that's coming
Saving grace please pull me through
In my doubt I can't believe
Like a wave tossed where the wind blows
Tears of faith temper my soul
Just another trial by fire
