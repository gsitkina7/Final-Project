The sun is on its way
Acting like it’s some new day
Your curtains hang the same
But the shade’s pulled down
I know that they did you wrong
Made it clear you don’t belong
But the world’s much bigger now than one small town
So pack three shirts
That old guitar
Your moonstruck poetry
And use that angel voice
To say you’ll come with me
Come with me
Together we run (Don’t give up or you’ll lose the fight)
Straight to the city lights
Together we run (Hold on to this with all your might)
Our lives begin tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Together we run, yeah
New York dreamеrs
Together we run
Wе’ll make some dreams come true
You know how I believe in you
Leave doubt and fear behind
A place to start again
You rehearsed this role with all your lines
You have what it takes to get it right
Step out into the light
You never dreamed of giving up
You’ve made your mark
There’s so much more
I’m knocking at your door
Imagine all you’ve done
You’re more than good enough
Together we run (Don’t give up or you’ll lose the fight)
On to the city lights
Together we run (Hold on to this with all your might)
Our lives should begin tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Together we run, yeah
Straight to the city lights
Together we run
Don’t give up or you’ll lose the fight
Hold on to this with all your might
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Together we run
You’ve made your mark
There’s so much more
I’m knocking at your door
Imagine all you’ve done
Don’t give up or you’ll lose the fight
Hold on to this with all your might
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Together we run
Don’t give up or you’ll lose the fight
Hold on to this with all your might
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Together we run
Don’t give up
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Together we run
Don’t give up
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Together we run
