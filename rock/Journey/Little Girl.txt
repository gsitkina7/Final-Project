It was just the month of May
Words got in my way
Girl I'm so sorry
So I'm reaching out to you
With the hope to see you through
Just another day
Do you see
The words I'm trying to say
But words get in my way
Girl I really mean it
Yes I warned you from the start
That I could break your heart
So girl don't stay
Oh, oh, oh
Little girl
Oh, oh, oh
Little girl
Oh, oh, oh
Little girl

I'm the fool that plays the part, the one
That broke your heart
Girl I'm so sorry
So what more can a poor boy do
I'm reaching out to you
So now don't you stay

Oh, oh, oh
Little girl
Oh, oh, oh
Little girl
Oh, oh, oh
Little girl

Shades turn red from green to blue
What more can I do
I told you this before
So please walk out that door
I told you from the start
That love could break your heart
Girl I'm so sorry

Oh, oh, oh
Little girl
Oh, oh, oh
Little girl
Oh, oh, oh
Little girl
