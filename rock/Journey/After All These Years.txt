A faded wedding photograph
You and me in our first dance
The lives of those
We lost in once sweet embrace
Since those days our world has changed
Our love remains the same
God knows we have had our share of saving grace
And I am proud of all the blessings
You have given me
The mountains we have climbed to get this far
You learn to take the laughter with the tears
After all these year
You make it feel brand new
After the fires that we walked thru
Against the odds we never lost our faith
In our hearts we have made our home
Where our children all have grown
Precious moments time cannot erase
We have been living up and down the gypsy highway
Seasons that we have learned to share apart
Somehow in my heart I always keep you near me
After all these years
After all these years
You stood by me
The days and nights that I was gone
After all these years
You sacrificed, believed in me
And you stood strong
Because with our love there's nothing left to fear
After all these years
