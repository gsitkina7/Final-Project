Two dreamers fierce in love
Two hungry hearts
Trying to outrun each other
Now we're miles apart
You saw it your way
And I was always right
Don't say you'll walk away
And give me one more night
We can't let foolish pride
Tear us apart this way
Don't give up on us now, baby
Just promise if there's love, we're fine
There is no way back for us, baby
Just know we can't quit now
Can't simply live without you
Can't let you walk away
We can turn this around
Don't give up on us, baby

Feel the distance, miss your touch
But, dear God, I've learned
Can't take what we have for granted
I'm gonna find some burns
I need to say it face-to-face
My love for you will never change
We both need forgiveness now
No one wins this game
Only makes us stronger
Just need you back in my arms

Don't give up on us now, baby
Just promise if there's love, we're fine
There is no way back for us, baby
Just know we can't quit now
Can't simply live without you
Can't let you walk away
We can turn this around
Don't give up on us, baby

Don't give up on us now, baby
Just promise if there's love, we're fine
There is no way back for us, baby
Just know we can't quit now
Can't simply live without you
Can't let you walk away
We can turn this around
Don't give up on us, baby

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby
