I'm workin' in the city
And this town's got no pity
My boss man owns a heart of stone
I'm on the line, it's overtime
I'll tell you it's a crime
They get me by the hour by my blue collar
Oooh, you're squeezin' me too tight
Oh, it's Friday night
Let's run tonight till the morning light
Keep on runnin'.  (Keep on runnin'.)
Keep on hidin'.  (Keep on hidin'.)
Keep on runnin' away.  (It's okay, it's alright, it's okay.)
It's alright, it's okay
And if it makes you want to jump and shout, go ahead
Keep on runnin'.  (Keep on runnin'.)
Keep on hidin'.  (Keep on hidin'.)
Keep on runnin' away
It's okay
Cruisin' with my baby
I think we might just maybe
I find some backseat rhythm and blues
Radio, I said now down we go
Oooh, baby, down we go
Keep on runnin'.  (Keep on runnin'.)
Keep on hidin'.  (Keep on hidin'.)
Keep on runnin' away
It's okay
(Guitar solo)
Keep on runnin'.  (Keep on runnin'.)
Keep on hidin'.  (Keep on hidi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-in'.)
Keep on runnin' away
It's alright, it's okay
And if it makes you want to jump and shout, go ahead
Keep on runnin'.  (Keep on runnin'.)
Keep on hidin'.  (Keep on hidin'.)
Keep on runnin' away
It's okay
