Down the lowest I can go
With no one left to turn
On the edge, I lose control
Before I crash and burn
Can I turn around
Slow it down, oh
Hold on, we have still got living to do
So far gone
See life for someone like you
In your eyes
You showed me reasons to live
Take time
The time it takes to forgive
It is my life, it will change for the better
I have faced the light
It is worth the fight
See a new day
Start a new way
Get it straight
Make it change for the better

I was dying, a drowning man
And I wish you well
Pull me from the darkness
And save me from myself
Wake up, shake it off
Let go
What I am pretending to be
I know
I am still the man I could be, yeah
It is my life, it will change for the better
I have faced the light
It is worth the fight
See a new day
Start a new way
Get it straight
Make a change for the better
I am waking up to find
A different state of mind
There was a new place, I am okay
I have changed for the better
I have opened up my eyes
I am glad to be alive
It is never too late
To cheat fate
Changed for the better
And now then there is no hope
Until we are faced without
We can never fall in love
Until we learn to live without
In our love we can't find peace
Without conflict in our lives
And the healing will begin, oh
Till we open up our eyes

Made my mind up
There is still time enough
I am all right
Made a change for the better

Change for the better
Change for the better, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I'm all right
Oh
