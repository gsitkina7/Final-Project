Feelin’ under pressure
Need somewhere where we can breathe
Where we can be
You and me, come on
Where we don’t need nobody, no
Tellin’ us what to do
Just somewhere where we can both feel free, yeah
We need to fly far away from here
To a place we can disappear
Need a change of scenery
It all comes down to you and me
Caught in all that just holds us down
Pack your bags, let’s leave
Come away with me
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
Come away with me
Hey, hey
As we face down the grind now
The more we see
When it’s all work and no play
We need release
(We need release)
We need to fly far away from here
To a place we can disappear
Need a change of scenery
It all comes down to you and me
Caught in all that just holds us down
Pack your bags, let’s leave
Come away with me
Hey, hey, hey
Come away with me
Hey, hey
Don’t need to fly down to St. Tropez
Just a beach where we both can lay
Need a change of scenery
It all comes down to you and me
Caught up in all that just holds us down
Pack your bags, let’s leave
Come away with me
Hey, hey, hey
Come away with me
Hey, hey
Come away with me, yeah
