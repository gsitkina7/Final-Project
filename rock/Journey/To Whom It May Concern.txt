Man is love man is animal
A warrior an intellectual
He is the face of original sin
He is the devil and the poet within
Our father's have embraced the messiah
Made the peace with Allah
Even sought to be like Buddha
To follow the old ways of Krishna
Pretending prophets come to rule this age
Turn the faith to fuel the wars they stage
Well something has to change to go beyond the pain
And somehow turn the page
To whom it may concern I'm sending out a prayer
The world finds peace in my lifetime
To whom it may concern are you listening
Are you There? I will keep my hopes for paradise alive
To whom it may concern

We simply want to live it free
So happy and in harmony
No guilt, no fear, no hell to burn

To whom it may concern I am sending out a prayer
The world finds peace in my lifetime
To whom it may concern are you listening
Are you There? I will keep my hopes for paradise alive
I close my eyes

To whom this may concern
We care you will see we are not cold
When flesh and bones our live is lord
And now we meet the gods who rule this age
Well nothing much has changed
Politicians, Landlords crowd our age
We simply want to live it free
So happy and in harmony
No guilt, no soul, no hell to burn
