Once in your life you love
Once in your life you try
The one you're holding
Is the one that tears you... apart
Deep in her arms you lie
Deep in the night her eyes
Tell your secrets
To the one you try to deny

Touch me, touch me crazy
How your kiss betrays me
It's not the love, it's just the rain
Two broken hearts
But not in vain
It's not the love, it's just the rain
Inside you keep on lying
Inside your soul is dying
You still can't hold back
Still you can't say good-bye


No reasons why, no one's to blame
It's not the love, it's just the rain
It's just the rain, It's just the rain
It's just the rain, It's just the rain
Falling, falling, falling
It's just the rain
