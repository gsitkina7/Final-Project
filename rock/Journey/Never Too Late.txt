Her head is filled with doubt
Search her heart for faith that cannot be found
He is running desperate now
All that he has become is just not working anymore
He is needing something more
Someone that he used to be
Part of her is a mystery
Spinning around in an empty place
Lie to themselves till they are blind with rage
It is never too late to feel the world come crashing down
It is never too late
It is darkest just before the dawn
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain
Never thought they would fall this far
You know it has never too late to change

So much to understand
So much to feel and finally now you can
They will see a different day all because they faced themselves
And now I hear them say they are going to be okay
She found who she used to be and now there is no mystery
Open his eyes in a brand new place
A different soul in a different place

It is never too late to feel the world come crashing down
It is never too late
It is darkest just before the dawn
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain
Never thought they'd fall this far

Love is waiting, love is patient, love is kind
Love is falling into places in their minds
They love enough to know the difference
The dream they had today, do not throw it all away
It is never too late to feel the world come crashing down
It is never too late
It is darkest just before the dawn
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain
Never thought they would fall this far
You know it is never too late to change

To rise above it all, never question, never fall
There is no mystery they are who they used to be
They are in a brand new place
A different soul and a different face
The dreams they had today, do not throw it all away
