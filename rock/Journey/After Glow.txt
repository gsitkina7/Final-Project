Our sacred space
Where we can melt away
Come with me now
The world is fading
Just you and me
Heart’s that beat together
Love is complete
Perfection waiting
Falling into you
Like a sweet summer rain
Somehow, we knew
Together, make moments
Last forever
Together, make moments
Last forever
Could be anywhere
With one look you take me thеre
Could be day or night
Soul and body, I am waiting
Out of the bluе
Feel me there for you
Ah, time can’t define
Where time is on our side
Fall into you
Like a sweet summer rain
Somehow, we knew
Together, make moments
Last forever
Together, make moments
Last forever
Can you pull me in?
Let the love begin
Afterglow
The afterglow
Beyond compare
So right, so rare
Afterglow
Ooh baby, the afterglow
Afterglow, the afterglow
Afterglow, the afterglow
Ooh, the afterglow, oh the afterglow
(Afterglow, the afterglow)
The afterglow, beyond compare
(Afterglow, the afterglow)
So right, so rare
Ooh, the afterglow
The afterglow
The afterglow
