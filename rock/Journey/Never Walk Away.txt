So young in love
They could not wait
Said their vows
Just to run away
Suddenly, they felt their lives had changed
They believed their hearts were strong
Just to find
They could not get along
They did not care
It slowly (falls or comes) undone
Will she go or will she stay? (will she stay)
Fool herself one more day
Do not give up
Never walk away!
Love is a promise that he made
In his heart it still remains
Do not give up
Never walk away!

Had to meet somewhere half way
Heart to heart
Face to face
Compromise the price they had to pay
Cared enough to stand on ground
Screamed and shouted 'til the walls came down
Won the fight
Still a brand new day

Never walk away
Oh, oh (never walk away)
Never walk away!
