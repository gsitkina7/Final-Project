I'd do anything
To hold you
I'd go anywhere
To touch you
I'd do anything
You want me to

If you'll just
Stay
With me awhile
I'd sing
Any song
Your heart desires
I would sing out loud of love's sweet fires
Oo, I'd do all this and so much more

If you'll just
Stay
With me awhile

Reach out your hand
Oh, to me
Oh, I'm falling
One minute
More
I'm falling
I'm falling
Oh, oh
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling
Won't you just
Stay
With me awhile?
