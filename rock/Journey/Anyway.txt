A place in time
Can make the grind
Fall out when you want to
Anyplace, anytime
All the world loves another
You know you can't find no other
Still I'm going to love you, yeah

Anyway
Dark at one
Are you having fun
Come on out with your play toys
You've got the blues on the run
All the world loves another
You know you can't find no other
Still I'm going to love you, yeah

Yes, I'm going to love you anyway yeah yeah yeah
No no no no no no no no no

Feeling low
How I loved you so
Cut out all your teasing
You may never know
All the world loves another
You know you can't find no other
Still I'm gonna love you, yeah
Yeah, yes I know

Anyway
