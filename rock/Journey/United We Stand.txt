This distance between us
I feel you pull away
Now I feel you losing ground
How did we get this way?
You cried out, I didn’t hear
You didn’t want to face the truth
Now I see I’ve been wrong
For all I put you through
 lonely
Never meant to hurt you
My true and my only
Tell me how I’ll make it up to you
(United) united we stand
(Divided) divided we fall
Love conquers all
Even when darkness comes to call
(United) united we stand
(Divided) divided we fall
Just hold onto me girl now
And together we can face it all
Face the prеssure now
Of our aging, changing world
The battle that surrounds us
Not with you and mе
More than even I need you now
As we face a brand new dawn
Don’t wanna lose you now
You’re my harbor in this storm
Oh baby
We’re better together
My life is here with you
Now and forever
Say with me there’s nothing we can’t do
(United) united we stand
(Divided) divided we fall
Love conquers all
Even when darkness comes to call
(United) united we stand
(Divided) divided we fall
Just hold onto me girl now
And together we can face it all, oh
We’re better together
My life is here with you
Now and forever
Say with me there’s nothing we can’t do
(United) united we stand
(Divided) divided we fall
Love conquers all
Even when darkness comes to call
(United) united we stand
(Divided) divided we fall
Just hold onto me girl now
And together we can face it all
(United
Divided)
United we stand
(United) united we stand
(Divided) divided we fall
Love conquers all
Even when darkness comes to call
But all that we need is
United we stand
