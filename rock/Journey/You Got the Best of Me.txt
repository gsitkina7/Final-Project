For so long, I wondered where my heart would lead me
Couldn't seem to find someone who would let me be me
Ended up in situations I'd regret
I chose to change my reckless ways instead

Wasn't looking for someone the night you walked my way
Just a look, I'd never be the same
This might sound crazy, I can build my life around you
Never walk away
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me

Baby, more I hear your heart, the more I want you
We've been down the same roads, broken dreams we've been through
I'll be your cover, keep you safe from harm, oh, yeah
You'll be my harbor from the storm, yeah

I believe I found a love the night you walked my way
From the first look, I'd never be the same, yeah
Stand together, build a life to call our own
And never walk away

You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me

You got the best
You got the best of me
You got the best
You got the best of me

You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me
You got, you want, you got the best of me

Yeah
Oh
Woo
You got the best of me
Forever
You got the best of me
When you need me
