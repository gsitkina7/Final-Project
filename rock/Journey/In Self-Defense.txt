The situation's got me rattled
I twist and turn late at night
This whole world is up in shambles
Who is the one to make it right
Missing persons lost in action (action)
Forgotten victims of the night (victims of the night)
They are making crime the main attraction (attraction)
They are making everyone uptight
They are all looking for a fight
In this confusion from day to day
Sometimes fear just makes no sense
In this crossfire I see one way
In self defense

You will take your chances, Mr. Policeman (policeman)
You are like a cat with thirteen lives (cat with thirteen lives)
Your law and order is our lifeline (lifeline)
Through the danger, you will survive
I do what I need to stay alive

In this confusion from day to day
Sometimes fear just makes no sense
In this crossfire I see one way
In self defense
In self (self) defense
