Hold me... Let me dry those tears for you
Be the healer... Of your heart he broke in two
I wanna hold you close... But somethin' tells me
To wait
Is it too soon to touch, to reach for the love that you hide away
Talk to me... Tell me with your eyes
What did he do... To make you feel this way inside

Empty words, and promises made
I'm not that way
Come to me and don't be afraid
I'm not that way
Silence... Was meant to be broken
Like waves on the shore let your tears wash away these emotions
I can't change the world, I can change your mind
I'll always be here, for you until you realize
Empty words, and promises made
I'm not that way
Broken trust... A failure in faith
I'm not that way
I'm not that way
Because life's too short for wasting
Wasting precious time
If time is what you need baby
I'll give you all of mine

One day you're going to look at me
And love is what you'll find
Empty words, and promises made
I'm not that way
Come to me
Bring back your faith
Don't be afraid
I'm not that way
I want to hold you
I want to hold you close
Let me hear your heart baby
