Young blood has got it shaking
Growing up, she's changing
She's so tough to try tame her
These days she just wants to run wild
Short skirt, loves her make up
Plays the flirt, it's daddy's wake up
He is on the edge of teen age shake up
It is so bad he is losing sleep at night
Because he was young once restless and free
An apple does  not fall far from a tree
She is the pride of the family
Stands above the crowd, makes them all believe
She is the pride of the family
When it's her time to fly
She has got love on her side

Photographs of her childhood
The years have passed
Where did they run to
Love still lasts the tears they have been through
Time's a thief as precious moments fly by
Dreamy eyes like her mama
Her temper flies like her papa
Her brother's cool and he has never been a bother
But he's someone to turn to
When life is no feeling right

Hold on loosely but never let go
The rest she will have to find out on her own

She is the pride of the family
Stands above the crowd, makes them all believe
She is the pride of the family
When it is her time to fly
She has got love on her side
