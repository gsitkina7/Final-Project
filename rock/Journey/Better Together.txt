Young and wild with a madness
I would not listen
I thought I knew just exactly
The way life would be, you see
You came along and you showed me
Just what I was missing
You opened my eyes with your sweet love
Oh, then I could see

They said it would not last
We proved them wrong
We learned to fly above the storm
Because we've always known that we belong
And we are better together
If we got our backs against the wall
Somehow we survive through it all
Knowing I will be there if you should fall
Oh, we're better together, all right, yeah yeah
Running alone, I was searching
While you were there waiting
Lessons in love I was learning
Were all right with me, you see
You changed my world and you gave me
Aw, the kiss you were saving
Ooh, we had each other to fight for
Ooh, when no one believed

They said it would not last
We proved them wrong
We learned to fly above the storm
Cause we have always known that we belong
And we are better together
If we got our backs against the wall
Somehow we survive through it all
Knowing I will be there if you should fall
Yeah, we are better together

Ooh it gets so lonely out there
Oh, playing my solitaire
Oh, Mustang
All right
Wait a minute
Young and wild with a madness
This time I listened, baby
You opened my eyes with your sweet love
Ooh, yeah, you set me free
They said it would not last
We proved them wrong
We learned to fly above the storm
Cause we have always known where we belong
Yeah we are better together
Oh, if we got our backs against the wall
Somehow we survive through it all
Knowing I will be there if you should fall
Oh we are better together
So much better, girl, we are better together

Better together, all right
Listen
Let us get together, let us get together, all right
Let us get together, well
Let us get together, let us get together right now
It is just, it is just better that way
