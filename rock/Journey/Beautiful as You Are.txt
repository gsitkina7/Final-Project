I watch you sleep
Not sure if you’re dreaming
Am I in that dream with you?
And I hope, my love will surround you
As you wake, you’ll reach for me
I’m amazed
With everything about you
Through the years I know
Stay beautiful as you are
Always, beautiful as you are
Ooooh, oooh, oooh to me
Always beautiful as you are
Under the moonlight
You pull me close
I feel your lips meet mine
Awake my soul
In every season you’re the sunshine that provides
You are the tide that takes me to the oceans deep and wide
You bring thе best in me
You show how me how to shinе
And you have stood by me
Without compromise
You earn my deep respect
You are what I adore
You are my shelter
I can face the storm
You’ll always stay as beautiful as you are
Ageless, eternal, you’re a soul on fire
The world around you see’s as beautiful as you are
And blessed you for all your heart’s desire
Watch the mountains move, oh, for you
There’s nothing in this world you can’t do
The many lives you touch are grateful how you care
I celebrate your life
The love that we share
You bring the best in me
You show how me how to shine
And you have stood by me
Without compromise
You earn my deep respect
You are what I adore
You are my shelter
I can face the storm
Always beautiful as you are
