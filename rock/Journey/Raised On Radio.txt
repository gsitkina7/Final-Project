Stagger Lee, can you Do The Locomotion
Lucille I hear you knocking but you can't come in
Rocking Robin, C.C Rider
A Rama Lama Ding Dong
Let the Good Times Roll
My Sweet Sixteen
I'm Maybelline
The Great Pretender
Returned To Sender
I wonder Why Fools Fall in Love
Yeah, Louie, Louie, loves drive-in movies
Johnny Angel Rocks Around the Clock
Mister D.J. make a dedication
Because I'm All Shook Up over Peggy Sue
I'm Mister Blue
The hits keep rocking station to station
In the Midnight Hour in the Sea of Love
My Turtle Dove
When I Found my Thrill, On Blue Berry Hill
We wrote Love Letters in the Sand
Be Bop a Lu La
She Loved Me Tender
Jungle Lion Sleeps Tonight
(Radio, radio)
We're all raised on (radio, radio)
I want my radio
