It's been forty days since I heard from you this waiting game
You put me through
I feel the silence... killing me... day to day
Losin' hope, I lose myself, it's got me thinking
There's someone else
We need to talk... You give me metaphors
By the way
What are you trying to say

Trying to not think about you
I'm not a dead man walking without you
You know I'll be alright
I'm showing signs of life
You left me barely breathing
I've had time for the healing
Now I've opened my eyes
I'm showing signs of life
Lying next to me... Were you ever mine
Just wasted love and wasted time
Did you ever find what you were looking for
The nights you took my breath away
I'll miss your love... Miss your touch, but this holding on it hurts too much
Now it's my time to walk away... I'll be okay


Well, tell your friends that you stole my heart
But you'll never get a piece of my soul
You took my love, tore my life apart
There's more to me than you'll ever know

Trying to not think about you
I'm not a dead man walking without you
You know I'll be alright
Showing signs of life
Trying to not think about you
I'm not a dead man walking without you
You know I'll be alright
I'm showing signs of life
You left me barely breathing
I've had time for the healing
Now I've opened my eyes
I'm showing signs of life
Seeing signs of life
