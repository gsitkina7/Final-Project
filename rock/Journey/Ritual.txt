Caught up in the daily grind
Hard to find some peace of mind 'round here lately
Try to escape the beaten path
Don't need the wrath of the world
It just drives me crazy, ooh, crazy
Just something to look forward to alone with you
I still get lost in you, baby
It's always you, baby
(Ah, lost in you)
Desire that comes together
Primitive animals
We've got something sacred
You've become my ritual
Our spirits feed each other
We never get our fill
Hungry for your sweet religion
You've become my ritual

When I'm with you, all time stands still
I find the will and pressure just doesn't phase me
You more than take my breath away
You captivate, we levitate, you amaze me
Ooh, baby
(Ah, lost in you)

Desire that comes together
Primitive animals
We've got something sacred
You've become my ritual
Our spirits feed each other
We never get our fill
Hungry for your sweet religion
You've become my ritual
My ritual
I want you, baby
Celebrate the love we found
You make my world go 'round
In your arms where I belong
Make sweet love all night long
All night long
You're all I see
Heaven's here with me
In this time alone
Set my spirit free
Free

Desire that comes together
Primitive animals
We've got something sacred
You've become my ritual
Our spirits feed each other
We never get our fill
Hungry for your sweet religion
You've become my ritual
My ritual
