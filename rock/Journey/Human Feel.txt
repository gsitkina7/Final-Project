In a jungle of hardware and mass frustration
Overloaded with way too much information these days
I am needing more than the virtual world I'm seeing
Could someone just let me talk to a live human being?
While automation and droids just keep on coming
Want to unplug right now, want to just start running
Caught up in the web as it weaves an illusion
A network of lies that giant ball of confusion
What I am missing is true emotion
I get lost in this digital ocean
What I'm needing right now is human feel
Cannot substitute love and passion
Show me you care, baby show me reaction
Coming straight from the heart, it's human feel
Rise up, find some compassion
It's not too late
Do not give up
What you feel it still matters, do not wait

Make it real, keep it real, human feel
Show me reaction, do not wait
Cannot substitute love and passion
Show me you care, baby show me reaction
Coming straight from the heart, it's human feel

Rise up
Find some compassion right now
Do not give up
Show me reaction, do not wait
Rise up
Make it real
Make it human feel
Rise up
Oh, rise up
Rise up
Make it real
Make it human feel
Rise up
Oh, rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Oh, rise up
Rise up
