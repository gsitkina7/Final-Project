Lost in a feeling
And this distance between us
I start believing
These days we are drifting apart
We are leading separate lives
Separately missing each other
It is time that we face the light
We cannot go on pretending this way

I want to get back to the place in your heart
When we knew with a kiss
How we felt from the start
Can we still make it real
As we lie in the dark
Am I still there
In the place in your heart
When was the last time
We were lost in the moment
Seems like we cannot find
Oh, the love that we used to share
If I could take you there
Could we surrender together
Somewhere to begin again
Oh, it hurts just to go this way
Yeah

I want to get back to the place in your heart
When we knew with a kiss
How we felt from the start
Can we still make it real
As we lie in the dark
Somewhere there is love
We have come this far
Reach out your hand and I will find where you are
Am I still there
In the place in your heart

Times that I let you down
You could have just walked away
Yes, I need your forgiveness now
Do not say it's too late, yes
I want to get back to the place in your heart
When we knew with a kiss
How we felt from the start
Can we still make it real
As we lie in the dark
Somewhere there's love
We have come this far
Reach out your hand and I will find where you are
Am I still there
In the place in your heart

Oh, let me take you there
Save a place for me baby
Save a place in your heart
Aw, let me take you there
Leaving
