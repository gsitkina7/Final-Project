Don't go
Oh baby, don’t go
Don't go
I need you, darling
Hey, hey
Don't go
Oh baby, don’t go
Don't go
I need your love
Said you were leaving
Our love left you lonely
You stood by your reasons
While I stood in silence, yeah, yeah
I took for granted what you mean to me
In my foolish pride I thought you'd always be there, oh no
Now I see the ways that I've been wrong, oh-oh
Come on baby, forgive me
You're where I belong
Oh, I said
Don't go
Oh baby, don't go (Don't go)
Don’t go (Don’t go)
I need you, darling
Don't go (Don’t go)
Oh baby, don't go (Don't go)
Don't go (Don’t go)
I need your love
You were my love
I waited a lifetime
Now this heart of mine
My world is crumbling down, oh-oh
If you and I had only walked that line
To balancе the time
As we walk that road
Now I see thе ways that I've been wrong
Oh baby, forgive me
You're where I belong
Oh, I said
Don't go (Don't go)
Oh baby, don't go (Don't go)
Don't go (Don't go)
I need you, darling
Hey, hey
Don't go (Don't go)
Oh baby, don't go (Don't go)
Don't go (Don't go)
I need your love
Oh, I need you my baby
Oh, I said
Don't go (Don't go)
Oh baby, don't go (Don't go)
Don't go (Don't go)
I need you, darling
Hey, hey
Don't go (Don't go)
Oh baby, don't go (Don't go)
Don't go (Don't go)
I need your love
Hey, hey
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Don't run tomorrow
I wanna build my world around you
It's only, it's only my heart, yeah
