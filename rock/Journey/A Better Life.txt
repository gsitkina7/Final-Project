Morning sunlight on her face
As he wakes her with a kiss
She has been everything he wanted
They were married as high school sweethearts
Never dreamed it'd be like this
Finding nothing for them comes easy
Trying hard just to make a living
Seems life will not give them a break
Well as long as they have got each other
Ooh, they will find a way
There is a better life
Waiting out there somewhere
They got to learn to fly
Need to spread their wings to soar
There is a better life
They will find it together (keep holding on)
She shows him rainbows every time he sees her smile

They have been more than lovers
There is no mountain they cannot climb
Cannot stop dreaming dreams together
Got to rise above the crossroads
Beyond the streets they were born
To a place where prayers are answered
And battles are won

There is a better life
Waiting out there somewhere
They got to learn to fly
Need to spread their wings to soar
There's a better life
They will find it together
They keep holding on
It only makes them strong
They want to learn to fly
Got to arise above the crossroads
Beyond the streets they were born
To a place where prayers are answered
And battles are won

There's a better life
Waiting out there somewhere
They got to learn to fly
Need to spread their wings to soar
There's a better life
They will find it together (keep holding on)
She shows him rainbows every time he sees her smile

There's a better life
(Waiting somewhere)
They got to learn to fly
