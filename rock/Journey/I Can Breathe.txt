Caught in a crowded city...buildings are closing in
Drowning in my emotion...cannot tell you where I have been
Out of place...running out of space
I get the urge to leave
With every step...I catch my breath

I am seeing the sky once more
Outside my door I will breathe
I can breathe
I am ready to try again
I will breathe
The weight that is upon my shoulders
The pressure that comes and goes
If only the ghost would leave me
That pushes and pulls my soul
I search to find some peace of mind
And now is the time to start
With every step I catch my breath

I am seeing the sky once more
Outside my door I will breathe
I can breathe
I am ready to try again
I am alive again I will breathe
With every step I catch my breath
It gives me my release
I can breathe
I am ready to try again
I am alive again I will breathe

Crowded city closing in...going to be alright
I remember where I have been...going to be alright
Feel the pressure come and go...it's going to be alright
Ghosts can push and pull my soul
Going to be alright...be alright
With every step I catch my breath
It gives me my release
I can breathe
I am ready to try again
I am alive again I will breathe...yes I will breathe
