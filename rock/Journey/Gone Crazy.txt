She fell out of bed and said, I am leaving this place
In a hot blooded, red-headed rage
She grabbed her things and slammed out that door
Jumped in the car, said, do not need you no more
She turned on the radio I said, hey, hey babe
Why do you have to treat me this way
She is wrapped up and wound herself way too tight
I think she is finally come loose this time

She is not the same, I cannot explain
She is gone away, I do not mean maybe
She is not the same, my burning flame
She is gone
She is gone crazy
She's driving me crazy
Well I rode down the highway, so she pulled off
Way past the point of getting lost
She calls me up on my mobile phone
I said, hey, hey babe
You are in the twilight zone
Call it blind luck but she found a way
Back to the scene where it all took place
And when she walked through that door it's all I could say
Hey, hey babe it's me that's changed

She is not the same, I cannot explain
She is gone away, I do not mean maybe
She is not the same, my burning flame
She is gone
She is gone crazy
Come on, get out of here
You are driving me crazy

I am not the same, I cannot explain
I am going away, I do not mean maybe
I am not the same
It is me that is changed
She is gone
She is gone crazy
She is gone away, no time to play
She is in the wings
No time to please
Come on, get out of here
She is driving me crazy

Go on, get out
Good-bye
