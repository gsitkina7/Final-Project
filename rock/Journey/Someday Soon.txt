Someday soon
Someday soon

Seasons were made for the change
You will be there
Just like the night to the day
Without a care
The dark goes before the dawn
Open up your eyes
Someday soon
Oh, there'll be a better day, and
Someday soon
Yes, it's not too far away
Someday soon
Oh yeah, with open skies, and
Someday soon
All we can do is try

The cloudiest day comes around
You will be there
All of the feeling's you've found
Without a care
So my friends, you take a look
Don't you look too far

Someday soon
Oo yeah, with open skies, and
Someday soon
All we can do is try

Someday
Someday
Someday
(Soon)
Someday
Someday
(Soon)

Someday
