'Cause in your head
Some pressure builds
Said something's coming
Coming down on you
'Cause the heaviness
Impression on your whole truth
Feeling emptiness
What you gonna do?

No time to hide it
No time to fight it
Let it rain
I said let it rain
Let it rain
When lightning strikes
No one feels safe
You can't stop the storm
You can't get near its rain
You can't plow the ground
Plant all your seeds
Skies don't open up
Never getting what you need

No time to hide it
No time to fight it
Let it rain
No time to hide it
No time to fight it
Let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, yеah

Yeah, up in the air, up in the air, up in thе air

No time to hide it
Oh, no time to fight it
Let it rain
No time to hide it
No time to fight it
Let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain
