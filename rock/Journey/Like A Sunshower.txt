Girl, tell me what is wrong
Are those tears in your eyes
What is going on between us
I am ready to listen
I do not care if it takes all night
We both said something we did not mean
We lost our heads
Now I cannot sleep
Till you talk to me
We find the sun through the rain
Caught in a sun shower
We will be all right, no one's to blame
After the storm, we will shine
So rare you and me disagree
Love's like a sun shower

When you meet me, babe
Somewhere halfway, yeah

It has been way too long
Since we shared what is in our hearts
Let us say this charade is over
Ooh, we cannot take for granted
How far we have come
Let us not lose each other
I know you care, cause you stand your ground
When we talked enough
I want to make up
Want to make love
We find the sun through the rain
Caught in a sun shower
We will be alright
No one's to blame
After the storm, we will shine
So rare you and me disagree
Love's like a sun shower
Baby, babe
Somewhere we will find
We will not regret
We will not forget
Rainbows wait for you and me
Girl, we are caught in a sun shower

When we have talked enough
Can we make up
Can we make love, ooh
Yeah
