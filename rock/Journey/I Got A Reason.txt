I wake with the morning light
Making love all through the night
Was I dreaming
Lying there I watch you sleep
One kiss before I leave, what you've done to me
I'm going to tell the world... Yeah

I got a reason to feel alive
You put the smile on my face
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town
Oh no... no... because I got a reason
I used to be a restless soul
All the dreams I could not hold
I was searching
I reached out and you were there, I never thought someone would care
The way you do
You got me shaking now girl


I want your love... Want you to stay... Oh yeah
You know you got me night and day
Every day

I got a reason to feel alive
You put the smile on my face
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town
Oh no... no... Because I got a reason... Yes I do
Oh no... no... Because I got a reason... yeah

Now I got a reason... Yeah
