He goes to work in a brand new dawn
With the early morning sunrise
He is got his dream and he's holding on
It is getting harder every day
He loves a girl who speaks her mind
Do not always look at life the same way
Sharing truth that will heal in time

They want to believe something real
Still they are searching
They are keeping the faith in the heartland tonight
Time moves on as the fading town
And they struggle with the changes
The stores have closed, friends have moved away
Now it is hope that sees him through
The kids have gone but they will see them all
At the Sunday congregation
Sharing dreams truth will heal in time

They want to believe something real
Still they are searching
They are keeping the faith in the heartland tonight
Ooh, it is words that divide them
It is love that defines them
They are keeping the faith in the heartland tonight

In our darkest hour, oh, we look to the sky
With a silent prayer
Believe that God's on our side
In a land where freedom rings
And where eagles fly
Ooh yeah, yeah

They want to believe something real
Still they are searching
They are keeping the faith in the heartland tonight
Yeah, it is words that divide them
It is love that defines them
They are keeping the faith in the heartland tonight
Ooh, I just want to believe it
Give me something to believe in
We all need something to believe in
In the heart tonight
Got faith
Got dreams
Yeah, we are keeping the faith alive
