It was a hot and steamy night
Then Frankie pulled his gun in sight
He said, "Now Suzi, don't you lie
Did Stevie, did he catch you with another guy?"

Standing in the line of fire it's going to shoot ya
Standing in the line of fire it's coming to ya
It's going through ya
He told her that he had been true
And that he'd never made her blue, no
So don't go saying Stevie's a liar
Girl, I've got my finger on a hair-trigger wire

Standing in the line of fire it's going to shoot ya
Standing in the line of fire it's coming to ya
It's going through ya
Bye, bye, bye, Suzi
So long girl


Those gunshots echoed through the town
Oh Frankie threw his shotgun down
That roof had moonlight shining through
She said she'd never, never, never, make him blue, yea

Standing in the line of fire it's going to shoot ya
Standing in the line of fire it's coming to ya
Standing in the line of fire it's going to shoot ya
It's going through ya
Bye, bye, bye, Suzi
So long
