I was captured by the light of a wayward smile
When she said to me
"Move slowly son and touch the sky
Very soon you'll see"

Oo, how precious time
Placed it's hand on me
Oo, how precious time
How it rescued me
See the line of sight in side your mind
But from where I don't know
And the tales that are left behind
Left for all to grow

Oo, precious time
Placed it's hand on me
Oo, precious time
How it rescued me

Oo, how it rescued me
How it rescued me

Oh, there's a place in time not far from here
A place we all could see
So if you're looking for a better day
Touch the sky and see

Oo, precious time
Placed it's hand on me
Oo, precious time
How it rescued me
Be the soldiers for your lives my friends
Fight for all to see
It's the only way to catch the sun
It's the only way you'll see

Oh, how precious time
Placed it's hand on me
Yeah precious time
How it rescued me
Baby, baby it rescued me

Oh, there's a place in time not far from here
A place we all could see
So if you're looking for a better day
Touch the sky and see

Oh, precious time
Placed it's hand on me
Oh, precious time
Oo, How it rescued me
