She never knew the meaning of the word
Or ever heard or felt of freedom
All she knew was looking out from windows
Streaked with her own tears and her own shadows
Within a cage, tried to escape
The silent rage
Cause no one ever listened
Behind her back, she's both wings tied
She will break free
She will not be denied
And so she
She flies alone
High into the great unknown
And no one there to tell her where to go
So she flies
Sweet butterfly

Counting every second, minutes turn to hours
Seems like years
The wait's eternal
Finally passed the point of all lost hope
She will break free
She will not be denied, oh no

And so she
She flies alone
High into the great unknown
And no one there to tell her where to go
So she flies
Like a butterfly, oh

Within a cage
Tried to escape the silent rage
But no one ever listened
Behind her back
She's both wings tied
She will break free
She will not be denied

Within a cage
Tried to escape the silent rage
Where no one ever listened
Behind her back
She is both wings tied
She will break free
She will break free
Sweet butterfly
