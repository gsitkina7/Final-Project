I still see the look in your eyes
The night you walked into my life
And how we danced
And the way that we touched
Let me know you would be mine
And how your love has set me free
An angel watching over me

You lift me up if I should fall
Showing me love
When I was blind to it all
I face the fire and I stand tall
Knowing that you love me
Shared my dreams, gave me wings to soar
My guiding light through the raging storm
I find my strength to carry on
Knowing that you love me
If I could, I would go back in time
To be there the day you were born
To hold you close
Or to see your smile
And rock you away in my arms
To stand beside you through the tears
Letting go of all the fears

You lift me up if I should fall
Showing me love when I was blind to it all
I face the fire and I stand tall
Knowing that you love me

Oh, someone to care
And someone to share
The little things that bring joy
To my life ooh, it scares me
We are so close but in my heart
It has got to know
I cannot imagine me in a world without you
(You lift me up)
You lift me up if I should fall
Showing me love when I was blind to it all
I face the fire and I stand tall
Knowing that you love me

Shared my dreams, gave me wings to soar
My guiding light
Through the raging storm
Ooh, I find my strength to carry on
Knowing that you love me
That is all I will ever need
Is knowing that you love me
