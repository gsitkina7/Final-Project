Winter and moonlight
It's an old-fashioned song
Julie's in blue jeans
Now her love has gone

She's an old-fashioned feeling
She's an old-fashioned song
Julie's in love now
But love has gone
It's a natural thing
It's a natural thing

I never knew her
I never tried
Julie would run by
Crying, teary-eyed

She was old-fashioned feeling
She was old-fashioned song
Julie's in blue lace
And love has gone
Her love has gone

It's a natural thing
It's a natural thing
It's a natural thing


Oh
She was old-fashioned feeling
She was old-fashioned song, yes Julie
Now Julie's in blue lace
And love has gone
Well, love has gone
Well, love has gone
It's a natural thing
(It's a natural thing)
It's a natural thing
()
It's a natural thing

Julie
