Up against the wall as you face your destiny
Don't let today's regrets affect tomorrow's dreams
When you shoot for the moon and you miss your mark
Baby you'll still end up so high among the stars
Anyone can give up when it's time to risk it all
Knowing where you stand and you will never fall

If you can see how you imagine your life
You want to dream now and you know that anything is possible
It's not who you are, it's where you want to go
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible
Take it brick by brick, throw away the stone
Take a chance on something, build a castle you call home
Live for the moment, you cannot put into words
Don't keep a song inside, let your voice be heard
Find your true desire, don't be afraid to cry
Better to reach for something, than to never have tried

It's time to see how you imagine your life
You want to dream, you know that anything is possible
It's not who you are, it's where you want to go
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible

It's not who you are, it's where you want to go
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible
It's time to see how you imagine your life
You want to dream, anything is possible
It's not who you are, it's where you want to go
You don't need a miracle, anything is possible

It's the choice you make, it's the time you take
It's the risk you take, you know that anything is possible
It's a choice you make, it's a time you take
It's a risk you take, believe that anything is possible
