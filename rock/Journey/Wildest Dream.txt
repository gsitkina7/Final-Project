Two different worlds collide
Somehow come together
Caught in the moment
Blind with desire
The way I want of you
I should have known better
Moving way too fast
Jumping through the fire
I cannot regret you
Somewhere we went wrong
I will not forget you
Long after you have gone
Oh, you are still in my wildest dream
Getting the best of me
The way you used to do
Tell me, do
Do you still think of me
The way I could make you feel
When love was all we knew
In my wildest dream, yeah

We had our time to shine
Before we started fading
Could not see eye to eye
Pretending nothing's wrong
We open up our eyes and asked when love was gone
I still think about you
And how you have been
Getting by without you
But still you come again

Oh, you are still in my wildest dream
Getting the best of me
The way you used to do
Tell me, do
Do you still think of me
The way I could make you feel
When love was all we knew
In my wildest dream
And on a bed of roses
Under the pale moonlight
I wait for sweet surrender
Until another night

Oh, you are still in my wildest dream
Getting the best of me
The way you used to do
Oh, tell me, do
Do you still think of me
The way I could make you feel
When love was all we knew
In your wildest dream

Cannot get you off my mind
In my wildest dream
Cannot get you off my mind
Oh, oh, in your wildest dream
Ooh, in your wildest dream, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
