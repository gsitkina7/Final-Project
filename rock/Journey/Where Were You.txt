Oh
Yeah

Where were you
When I wanted you to love me through the night?
Where were you
When I wanted you to love and hold me tight?
Where were you, little darling
When you said to pick you up after school?
I know where, little lady
Because my mama didn't raise no fool
Yeah, oh
Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you?

I know where, baby
You been running around loose on the side
Cause I know where, little lady
You been running around with something to hide
I don't mind, darling, if you're feeling fancy and free, yeah
I don't mind, little baby
Because your sister's looking real good to me

Yeah, hey, hey
Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you?


I won't know what the hell was going on
Someday you're gonna break
So don't try to get yourself straight
You're just a little too late
Where were you?
Where were you? (Oh)
Where were you? (Oh)
Where were you? (Hey!)

Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you?
