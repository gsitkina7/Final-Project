Morning comes
Miss your light
Want you near
Evening falls
Need your touch
Wish you were here
I feel
I’m sure
Gotta be close
Time with you, baby
Is what matters the most
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
The way I want ya
All day and all night
Now my life’s about ya
All day and all night
You and me
Time stands still
Whenever we kiss
Start a fire
All we desire
What’s more than this?
I say
Seasons come and maybe go
Our love’s forever more, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
The way I want ya
All day and all night
Now my life’s about you, yeah
All day and all night
I say…
Seasons come and go
Our love, our love’s forever more, yeah
The way I want ya
All day and all night
Now my life’s about you
All day and all night
All day, all night, all day I want ya
All day, all night, all day I love ya
