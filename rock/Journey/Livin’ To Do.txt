A message comes down... It's a warning
It's not your time, oh no it ain't, but it's coming
Now what makes us think, we're here forever
When life is gone, life is gone, before you know
It's over
A church in the rain... A sad congregation
An old friend I knew
When I look at the end... I understand now
I got living to do... There's still living to do
With every breath, comes deeper meaning
I don't want to waste, I don't wanna waste
One single minute
Tears fall from the sky, angels are crying
They cry for those... Who don't know that
They're dying
I wait for the sun... A chance at a new day
There's no time to lose
When I look at the end... I understand now
I got living to do... There's still living to do
When I look at the end... I understand that
I got living to do
Whoa
There's still living to do
