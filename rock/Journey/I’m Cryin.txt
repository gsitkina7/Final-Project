Oo, I'm crying
Tears are falling down
I'm crying
The lonely tears of clowns
I'm trying
To wear a smiling face

It was just yesterday
Things then they felt okay
Now that has all gone
Away
I'm crying
The only tears of clowns
I'm trying
Trying and rain's falling down
I'm crying
And that's a lonely place

If I could hide the pain
If I could stop the rain
Then all my crying
Could be gone


Oo, rain
Who will stop the rain
The rain?

I'm crying
The tears are falling down
I'm trying
The rain still beats the ground
I'm crying
Those lonely tears of clowns
Lonely, lonely tears
Lonely, lonely tears
