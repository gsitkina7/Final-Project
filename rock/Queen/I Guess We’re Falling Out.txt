You stabbed your knife right in my back
Was it just something that I might have said
Does this mean we're falling out
I guess this means that our love has fallen out
If you wanna make a go
I guess we're falling out
It was just one gone and gone away
I guess we're falling out
Guess we're falling out
Da, da, da, I wanna stay
(An ad-libbed verse)
I guess we're falling out
It was just one long race
I guess we're falling out
Falling out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, falling out, falling out, yeah
Two, three, four
Make it a whole, a whole, a hey
On, and on, and on babe
Ohh
Yeah, yeah, it's a
Falling out
Hey
Make it a whole, a whole, a hey
On, and on, and on babe
Ohh
Yeah, yeah it's a
Falling out, falling out, yeah
Two, three, four
I guess we're falling out
It was just one gone and gone away
I guess we're falling out
Guess we're falling out
Da, da, da, I wanna stay
