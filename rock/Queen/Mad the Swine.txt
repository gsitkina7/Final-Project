Been here before a long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water

Three feet tall, so very small
I'm no trouble
I bring thunder, lightning, sun and the rain
For all the people in the land
A message of love
I bring you from up above
All good children, gather around
Come join your hands and sing along

They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

I'll walk upon the water, just as before
I'll help the meek and the mild, and the lepers and the blind
And all the creatures
Great and small

Let me take you to the river without a fall
Oh, and then one day you realize
You're all the same within his eyes
That's all I've got to say, just like before
They call me mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Oo-ooh

Woah, now
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Don't ever fail me!

Mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you (Woah, now)
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Hands and praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Get down on my knees and praise the Lord
