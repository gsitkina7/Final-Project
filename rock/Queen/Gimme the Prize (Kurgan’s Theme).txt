In the garage and water
From the sprinklers
It also left a man's decapitated body
Lying on the floor
Next to his own severed head
A head which at this time
Has no name
I know his name...

Here I am
I'm the master of your destiny
Ha-ha
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize

Give me your kings
Let me squeeze them in my hands
He-he-hey
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize (The prize)

Now you die!
I have something to say
It's better to burn out
Than to fade away
There can be only one!
Move over, I said move over
Hey, hey, hey, clear the way
There's no escape from my authority
Didn't I tell you?

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize (The prize)
Just give me the prize (The prize)

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
So give me the prize
There can be only one!
