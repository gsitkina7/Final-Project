Keep your chin up
When you're feeling lonely
Don't let 'em get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting
All alone, hanging around
For someone to call, oo-oo-ooh
They won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said, "give as good as you get"
Yeah!
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

Come on, go
Get up!
Hey-hey!
It sure feels good

Keep your big hands off of my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine
And dine me, trying to wind
Me 'round and around and bind me
To your legal contract (Ha ha!)
Rumour has it that you can play it dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do
About that, that yeah!
I'll play you at your own game!
Yes
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah
That's good
Play it again!


(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
Oh, you'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
It's everyone for themselves!

Move on out!
Hey!
Oh, I like it!
Rock 'n' Roll ready! Yeah
Woo-hoo!
