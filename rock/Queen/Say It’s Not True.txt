The harder we play
The faster we fall
When we think that we know it all
We know nothing at all

The letter arrives
Like a bolt from the blue
So what is left of your lives
All your dreams lost to you
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me
{Verse 2}
It is hard not to cry
It is hard to believe
So much heartache and pain
So much reason to grieve
With the wonders of science
All the knowledge we have stored
Magic cocktails for lives
People just cannot afford
{Chorus}
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me
