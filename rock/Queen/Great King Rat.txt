Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty-first of May
Died, syphilis, forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Now hear this

Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg? Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care (anyway)
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you (Ah, yes, I told you)
And that's no lie (Oh, no, no)

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Show me!

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
People (People)
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Hit it!

Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what Mama says
Not a word, not a word Mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival (sure)
The great Lord, before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said "You're going to realize tomorrow"

No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on, the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?
