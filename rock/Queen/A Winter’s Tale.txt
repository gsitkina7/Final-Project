It's winter fall
Red skies are gleaming, oh
Seagulls are flying over
Swans are floating by
Smoking chimney tops
Am I dreaming? Am I dreaming?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon
Up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasizing
Grown-ups are standing by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Woh-woh-woh-woh
(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming) There's a kind
Of magic in the air
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand


(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry
Laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of, the hope of the man

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting
In the sky, yeah!
Mountains are zooming higher, uh
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinning
And spinning, and spinning
It's unbelievable, sends me reeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Oooh
It's bliss
