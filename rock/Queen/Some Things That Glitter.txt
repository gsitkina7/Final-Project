Once I loved a butterfly
Do not wonder how, do not ask me why
But I believed what I would have been told
All things that glitter cannot be gold

Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter cannot be gold

Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all
Her pride is headed for a fall

Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the Sun
Reaching and doping we will find the right one
Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold


So let us mind what is there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we have been told
Some things that glitter may be gold
{Chorus}
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter
May be gold
