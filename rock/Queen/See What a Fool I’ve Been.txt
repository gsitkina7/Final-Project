Well, she's gone, dear
Gone this morning, mmh yeah
Ow, see what a fool I've been - oh Lord, I say
What a fool I've been
Yes, I did

Too much
Didn't leave me-me no letter, didn't leave no warning
You naughty thing, you
Ooh - well I guess I am to blame oh lord
I guess I'm all to blame - see you later, sailor boy
Child, right now you take it
Hope my little dog ainâ€™t too hungry
No, no, he just kept on barking, the vicious thing
Just don't seem the same, oh, no, no
It just, oh tantrums, it don't feel the same
Ooh, see you later
Now hit it, like that
Coming on strong


Oh, well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said "Ah ooh ooh ooh ooh"
Oh Lord
What a fool I've been
And she told what to do
She said "Go home!"


Well she's gone - gone this morning
See what a fool I've been, oh lord
What a... foo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool... I've been
Thank you
