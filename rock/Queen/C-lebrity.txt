Oh yeah
Have got no hope, got no idea
What to do or why I am here
I want to get my face on your T.V
I want to be heard
I want to be seen

I have got nothing, no, nothing
Nothing to show
(Make me a celebrity!)
I want to be
A face on T.V
(I want to be on your screen)
Then you can see
I am a C-lebrity

I want to get my features in magazines
See this creature on every street on every screen
Write my life story before I'm twenty-one
I have got to tell the world
They may say I am dumb - but er

Have got nothing, no nothing
Nothing to show
(Make me a celebrity!)

I want to be
A face on T.V
(I want to be on your screen)
Then you can see
I am a C-lebrity
(Yeah!)
I want to be a star in a Broadway musical
They are going to love me, I cannot sing or dance at all
Some may say I am lackadaisical and if I was real good
I would stand no chance at all - but I
I want to be
A face on T.V
(yeah, I want to be on your screen)
Then you can see
I am a C-lebrity
(Then you can say)
Then you can say
You knew me one day
(And then you will see)
Then you will see
I am a C-lebrity
(Oh oh oh)

C, c-lebrity
Want to be a c-c-c-lebrity
(Make my dream come true)
C, c-lebrity
Want to be a c-c-c-c-lebrity
I want to be heard
I want to be seen on every T.V. screen
Yeh
