They were born with the knowledge of the struggle to survive
They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun
If you can see them coming, baby better run

Here come the war boys
Here come the war boys

Well they look so pretty as they march and drill
It is such, a pity that they are dressed to kill
Soldiers marching two by two
When it all comes down they know exactly what to do
Here come the... war

War boys, war boys, children and their toys
War boys, war boys, make lot a noise
War boys, when the lightning explodes
I pray for your soul

Hop...2...3...4
Well they look so fierce they are going to tear out your heart
When they get near we are going to see what they got
Hold on to your soul, friend of mine
I will see you in hell, some other time

Here come the boys
Helping to kill, those who deserve to die
Tell me who decides
You and I
We have the power
