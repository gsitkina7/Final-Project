I cannot wake in the morning
I cannot sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just will not sit right
You might say I am losing my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I do not want and I do not need
To play the crying game
Music lights this flame in me
I will not let it go and it will not let me be
I am just a happy slave and oh I cannot leave it
Because I am still, and I always will - be a believer
Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning (and the wheel's)
Still turning (ooh let me tell you why)
We are jiving (and the beat's)
Still driven (and we are all)
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)

I cannot breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everything seem to go wrong
You might think I am playing around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe
That sweet soul magic
Going to tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go round
I have been flying on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I am still a believer
Heading for the stars

Oh yeah
Still burning, still yearning
Still burning
Still yearning
Still turning (better than every guy)
We are jiving
Still driving
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)
Do not say that you love me I cannot go that road
But do not think for a moment that my heart went cold
I keep thinking about what I lost
And what I might have found
I went to sleep and when I woke
Everything had turned around

Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning
Still turning (a new day dawning)
We are jiving
Still driving
Sky diving (early in the morning)

Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning (and the wheel's)
Still turning (better than every guy)
We are jiving (and the beat's)
Still driving (and we are all)
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)
