Cross my heart and hope to die
I don't need another guy
To fight my battles
To overshadow me
Don't you know I'm dangerous?
Fire burning in my blood
I got this handled
I don't need rescuing
You can call me a princess all you like
'Cause you like to keep me helpless by your side
But it ain't what I want, I'ma show you, I'ma show you
How to treat me like a queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
So treat me like a queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
Eyes on me like I'm a prize
But you better recognize
I'm not your angel
'Cause I belong to me
You can call me a princess all you like
'Cause you like to keep me helpless by your side
But it ain't what I want, I'ma show you, I'ma show you
How to treat me like a queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
So treat me like a queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?

'Cause you like to keep me helpless by your side
But it ain't what I want, I'ma show you
