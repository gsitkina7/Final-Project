A hand above the water
An angel reachin' for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven?
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the brokenhearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you
Another tricky situation
I get to drowning in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do? (Ooh)
Yes, it was such an operation (Ooh)
Forever payin' every due (Ooh)
Hell, you made a sensation (You made a sensation)
You found a way through (You found a way through)

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever

And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never saying goodbye
And it's one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun

Crying for nothin'
Crying for no one
No one but you
