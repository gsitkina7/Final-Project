Yeah
Ha ha
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

Yeah, I took my baby dancing
To see a heavy band
But never saw my baby till the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
Didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

I wouldn't mind the postman
If the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man, electric man, a man who'll fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock and roll clone
And leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
Go ahead, fool

All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more
So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more
Yeah
Yeah!
Go crazy, woo!
Yeah, yeah!

I don't wanna hurt you
Like you've been hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching, rolling on the floor
Next time you're on the TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way, baby

All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

Ooh!
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta stay away from me, baby
Baby, crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, woo!
