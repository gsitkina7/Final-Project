And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered 'round Him
The beggars shouted, the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about Him

All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus (going down)
All going down
Then came a man before his feet he fell
Unclean, said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now, go now
You're a new man instead
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus (right)
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man

All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down (going down to Bethlehem)
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down


It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man, that's right

All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
