When the moons rises
The dogs will howl
Look out of your window
I will be on the prowl
I am not usually
A gambling man
But oh I just want to
Hold up my hands

And say I am
Taking a chance on you love
Whoa I am taking a chance on you love
I am not superstitious
And I do not wear no charm
I do not carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck
Please do not worry me
Cause when I look in the mirror
Here is the future I see

I am taking a chance on you love
Whoa, I am taking a chance on you love

Place your bets, Better yet
Do not forget, What I said
Roll the dice, Spin the wheel
Always remember, You have got to keep it real
Do not believe in voodoo
Black magic was never my style
But I believe you do
And it will not take much time
To gather the portions
That weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean
Has a secret to tell
But anyway I am
Taking a chance on you love
Whoa I am taking a chance on you love
