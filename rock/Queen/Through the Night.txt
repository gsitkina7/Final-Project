Tell me something that will ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying does not help me any more
Tell me something that will ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying does not get my anywhere

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night
Tell me something cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
I cannot face it and there is no place I can hide


Tell me something cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Without your love there is nowhere I can hide
