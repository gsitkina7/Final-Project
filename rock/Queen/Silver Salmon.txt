Like silver salmon
She falls
They're all burning
Even at a  for all, yeah
Deep inside they're all burning

Look out, silver salmon
Look out, look out, look out, silver salmon
All along the silver skies, ah
More alarming
All the need for silver, ah
Went away

Salmon
Look out, look out, silver salmon
Ooh, yeah

Seems to me sometimes in trees
She burns leaves
Her body lies a-burning
And falls into the cold sunrise

Oh, duh-duh-duh-duh, ow
Ooh
Silver, silver salmon
Silver, silver
Riding on the silver salmon
She can ride the burning sky, yeah
