Ooh
See your face - you've got no-one to love you back
You better, better win this place - you know it's the promised land
Don't let it hold you
Don't let it
You better
You bet it
It's gonna hold you
You bet it's gonna take control
That tears your soul
Trust - that'll make you self believe
To be a self made man
Turn that stuff - that defines your role to be, ooh
To be a self made man
Get a heavy job - don't let them moguls waste your time (she's going down the line)
To be a self made man
Do you wanna be my honey?
Do you wanna be my girl?
Do you have the time to meet me?
Do you wanna be my honey?
Do you wanna be my girl?
Do you have the time to meet me?
Yeah
Self made, self made man
Ooh, girl gotta make yourself believe
Gotta turn that stuff, see your face, know I'm a made man
In this place, known promised land
Self made man
Self
Be a self made man
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, be a self made man
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, be a self made man
Self made man
Self made man
