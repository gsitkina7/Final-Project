Had to make do with a worn out rock 'n' roll scene
The old bop is getting tired, need a rest
Well you know what I mean
'58, that was great, but it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab ya hard, make you feel ten feet tall

Well I hope that big new baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know, it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down and the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin' like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know that there's one thing every single body could use
Yeah, listen little baby, let me tell you what it's all about

(Modern times) Rock 'n' roll
(Modern times) Rock 'n' roll


Get your high heel guitar-style boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest and a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says he's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants, think you should go far
Everybody in this bum-sucking world's gonna know who you are

(Look out)
