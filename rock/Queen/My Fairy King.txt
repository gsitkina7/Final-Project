Ah, ah

In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows through the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on, on, on, on
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)
My fairy king (He rules the air and turns the tides)
He rules the air and can see things that are not there
For you and me to see (Ooh, yeah)
My fairy king (He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong

(Ah) Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh)

They turn milk into sour, like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
(Son of heaven set me free and let me go)
Sea turns dry, no salt from sand
And seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes (No more)

Someone, someone
Has drained the color from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Oh, Mother Mercury (Mercury)
Look what they've done to me (Yeah)
I cannot run, I cannot hide
