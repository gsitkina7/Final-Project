Surf is up
School is out
I got a criminal urge to
Twist and shout

I have been searching
My whole life through
For some perfect dream
Imagined in my youth
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Surf is up – School is out

For a perfect life
Find a perfect girl
You got to follow that dream
To a perfect world
I have been a searcher
An adventurer too
This ride still runs
I want to ride with you
This ride still runs
Want to ride with you

Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Surf is up – School is out

In the town and the country
We all lay and dreamed our dreams
Then we found the world is tough
And all is not quite what it seems
Got to take it by the horns
Got to seize your precious day
Got to follow your dream
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf up - School's out
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
