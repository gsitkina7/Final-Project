That's the way I am
Does everybody want to know
This is the way I lead my life - you know
Wheeling and dealing
And a little bit of stealing
You know that's the way I grew up
That's the only life I know
That's the way my mother taught me
There you go
Stealing
I gave you the key to my home
I left you alone in charge of my heart
Hey stealing
You got me wheeling and dealing
You play with my feelings
Right from the start
Can't afford to pay my rent
I had to use my common sense
To get some money I owe - oho
This guy said look in my head
Make some easy bread
Stealing is the only way that I know
Stealing yeah only way that I know
Yeah I like stealing baby stealing
I gave you both my heart and my home
Left you alone
Now you'll be stealing stealing stealing
All my heart
You're my baby's heart
Uh uh
Baby let 'em bleed
You're in charge of my heart
You are in charge of my heart
You are in charge
You are in charge
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Yes you are in charge of my heart
I gave you the key
And turned on the bed
I gave you the key
Come on I said what have I got
What have I got
Yes
I, I got the key out of my heart
Now get that key out of my heart
You're in charge of my heart
Come on
