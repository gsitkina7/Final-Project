Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, alright
Every day, every night
I see you walking down with that other guy
I see your face, you're not satisfied
I know you wanna, you wanna hide
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like
Do you know it, know that, know that
Come on baby, you give me the come on
I love you, baby, come on and let's make it right
Ooh, you're so good looking and baby
You're so smooth
I know you have
Come on baby, wish me luck
I wanna be there, in that truck
Come on and give me that feeling
Come on give it, oh, that feeling
Oh, I want you rockin' on, right by my side
Come on, come on, and take my side
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on and get me, get me
I wanna take you with me
But don't you let me, let me, oh come on
Let me give you a good time
Ohh yeah, give you a good time
Like we've never had
Promises never be free
I've heard them all
Every day and night you know I'm OK
Funny things happen, I don't know what you're talking about
Make you, you make me
I'm gonna wish that I had
Just you, just you, I want you, I love you
It's been so hard
Take it into your eyes
Feel like
Give me the pieces, pieces of your heart
I love you, I love you, love you, love you, love you
And make a big start
Brand new start
Let's make a brand new start
Ooh, let's make a brand new start
I'm giving you that broken heart
Oh, I need you baby
Come on and baby, tell me what you feel
You can have me, we'll make a deal
Broken pieces left on the side
Oh, come on don't hide
I love you, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
That's 'cause I love you
I love you, I love you
Oh, come on and take me
'Cause I need your
I need your loving
