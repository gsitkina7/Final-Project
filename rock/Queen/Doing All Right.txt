Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, I know what I'm doin'
Got a feeling I should be doing all right

Doing all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow?
Anyway, I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Should be waiting for the sun
Looking 'round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
Every time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway, I've got to hide away

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh
Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, God knows what I'm doin'
Anyway, I should be doing all right

Doing all right

Doing all right
