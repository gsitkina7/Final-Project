Uh, ooh
Yeah

When people talk of love
I'll lead the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine
Happy with my situation
But when I look away, huh
People know my mind is straying
To where I once belonged
Dreaming about your heart again
(Your heart again) Yeah
Your heart again
Let me in your heart again
Listen to me honey

When you have to face the blues
I give you satisfaction
(It's your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction
(It's your heart again)
So don't you walk away
Remember it's my heart you're breaking
You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain

(Your heart again) Oh
(Your heart again) Heart again
Let me in your heart again

Oh, my love
I want you to stay
Don't leave me now
Or I'll just fade away
Oh, my love, don't hurt me this way
Oh, forgive me, babe
Do not ever tell me goodbye
Ooh
Tell me yes
Oh
Don't make me wait too long
Or I'll lose my mind

When people talk of love
I have no hesitation
(It's your heart again)
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I'll hold that conversation for you, baby
(It's your heart again)
(Ooh) But when I look away, huh
(Ooh) People know my mind is straying, baby
To where I once belonged
Just let me in your heart again (Heart again)

Your heart again (Heart again)
Oh, (Let me in) let me in your heart again (Your heart again)

Open the doors for me, baby
To your heart again
Let me in
Hey, let me
Let me live, uh
Whoo!
Let me live and live in your heart again
