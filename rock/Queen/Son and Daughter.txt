I want you-ooh, ahh
Woman

Tried to be a son and daughter
Rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man
For having your fun

Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you-ooh
To be a woman, yeah

Tried to be a teacher
And a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?

Well, I traveled around
The world and found
A brand new word for day
Watching the time, mustn't linger behind
Pardon me, I have to get away
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?

I want you-ooh
To be a woman

I want you to be a woman, yeah
You know I'm gonna save the world
Now you've just begun
Alright!
