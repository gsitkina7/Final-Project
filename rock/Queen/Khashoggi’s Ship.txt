Who said my party was all over?
Huh, huh, I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life
Are like a supernova
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that!
Everybody drank my wine
You get my drift
And then we took a holiday
On Khashoggi's Ship, well
We really had a good, good time
They was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed
All in all, it was a pretty good trip
This big bad sucker
With a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass, honey
He pulled out a gun
Wanted to arrest me
I said uh, uh, babe
Now listen no-one stops my party
No-one stops my party
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party
Just like I said
We were phased, we was pissed
Just having a total eclipse

Bup bup, badabup, badibup bup bup
Bedabup bedadee hey
That's good
Oooh
Wooh wooh wooh
Wooh wooh wooh, hah!
This one's on me so let us do it just right
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight
Yeah
Hey! Hah!
Everybody's party to the left
Party to the right
Lay mine in the middle
Do it all night, alright alright, hey
Two within the middle with you
We're going buddy
Hey uhh, hey huh
Alright, hey
Left, right, left, right
No one stops my, Aaahh!
