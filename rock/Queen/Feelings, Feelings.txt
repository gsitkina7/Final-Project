One, two, three
Woo

Gotta get rid of this feeling, I'm feeling done
Yes, I've gotta get rid of this feeling that's under my tongue (Keyset)
I've been waiting so long, I've got to be all the fingers and thumbs
Oh, sitting all alone with just a feeling, I'm feeling bad
Yes, that feeling is driving me, it's driving me mad
Oh, now that I'm here, got to give you all that I ever had
Sure do
Now that I'm here, I can see you so clearly
It's the way I should say it
It's not what I say, it's the way that I say it
It's not how I play, it's the way that I play it
Ooh, wooh, wooh, yeah, I feel, yeah

Now, that I'm here
Oh, got to get a rid of this feeling I'm feeling inside, yes
Got to get you into that feeling that's driving me mad, alright, baby
Oh, now that I'm here, I've got to give you all that I ever had
Stop
Yes
