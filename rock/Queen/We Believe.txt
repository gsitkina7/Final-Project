I believe there is no evil out there we did not have a hand in
You believe it is a time for peace and a time for understanding
Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side we will win the game
And some of us believe that there is a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let us get it straight
I believe there is just once chance in this world to hear our brothers
You believe there is a better way to listen to each other
We do not get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we do not understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down
We believe there is a better way to fight
There is a way to make our children safe at night
We believe there is a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive

I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows
You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill
A man or a woman who knows how to say I am sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes
Match the intent with the deed

We believe there is a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation - in our time
We believe there is not a minute we should be wasting
When the darkness falls it is too late to fix the crime
It is peace that we need

Every father every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get
We believe there is a song that is worth the singing
It is a song of truth we are bringing
There is a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun
That's what we believe
