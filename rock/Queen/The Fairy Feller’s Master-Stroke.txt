He's a fairy feller

Ah, ah, the fairy folk have gathered
Round the new-moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut
At night's noon-time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke
Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
Dirty fellow, what a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
(Can we see the master stroke)
What a quaere fellow

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania
Watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen
And there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow

The ostler stares
With hands on his knees
Come on Mr. Feller
Crack it open if you please
