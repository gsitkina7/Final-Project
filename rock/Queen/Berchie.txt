You’re mine
Somehow I always just take you back in
Hate when we fight but we here to the end
Make me think about the very first time
When we exchanged notes and layed up all night
Crazy that I’d thought I never know
That I’d find love in this generation of empty souls
Swear I thought I would never even come see this far
Cuz feelings sometimes will make me feel like Im dead and gone
But all that changеd when I met you
Knew at first glacе something was true
You was there chilling with your friends
Swear you looked so effortless
Dont Know if I walk up or ignore ya baby
You was glowin Like the moon
I was nervous I’d fall through was wrong baby
From ya demeanor It looked like I came on you too strong
You flash smile and then ask of my name and where Im from
Then you look me up and and down to see what time Im on
Whether I am just a typical
Or if sing a different song
Cuz you know that nobody perfect
Busy searching for something thats real
You don’t know in my my mind that your worth it baby
That is why I already feel
Chorus
I have never felt so strong about somebody
You are everything I need and more
Like a drug I can’t get you right out my body
When Im diving in deep your core
You my shawty, my boo thang forever baby
Imma show you off all to the world
When I look in your eyes I see heaven baby
You’re my Queen til the end do us part

You’re my queen til the end do us part
You’re mine
Verse 2
Lovely
Can I get your number
Can I just get something bout ya for me to remember
Promise I won’t waste ya time like other dudes do you love
Don’t know how it worked
But somehow we just started talking over the phone and then all of a sudden
One text turned to two then turn to FaceTiming from night til dawn
Moved from hanging out to when the first date will be on
First date turned to second then to many years just to ask
Will you be Vanessa and to you I’ll be Gigi’s Dad
You on my mind for 24 hours and 7 days
I spend 8 of them thinking how I can make you say
Oh baby, I love you
And always know that I love you too
Chorus
I have never felt so strong about somebody
You are everything I need and more
Like a drug I can’t get you right out my body
When Im diving in deep your core
You my shawty, my boo thang forever baby
Imma show you off all to the world
When I look in your  eyes I see heaven baby
You’re my Queen til the end do us part
