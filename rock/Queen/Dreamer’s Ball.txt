Oh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy, hmm
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy

Oh, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you
Oh take me, take me
Take me to the dreamers' ball
I'll be right on time
And I'll dress so fine
You're going to love me
When you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me
Til it's morning, it's all been true

What d'you say about that, hey honey?
You gonna take me
To that dreamers' ball?
I'd like that
Right on that 42nd street
Way down, downtown dreamers' ball

Oh take me, take me
Take me I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely
Perceptible whisper
Gently take me
Remember I'll be dreaming
Of my baby at the dreamer's ball
Take me, hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamers' ball
I'll meet you at the dreamers' ball
