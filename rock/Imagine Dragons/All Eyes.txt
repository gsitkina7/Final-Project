Everything you say is just a lie and now I'm leaving
To the city where the people are awake to chase a dream that isn't real
And we're 'posed to be something that we're not
Just wanna change a lot and sign our name after the dot
Everything you see is just a century of anarchy
All my corresponding colors that symbolize the things we can attest
Arrange, we can assess, we can attain
We are the entry for entities to entice and entertain

All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
Take my side
Take my side, don't look back
Now I'm easy and that's a fact
And you're on my mind, oh

Everything you say is just a lie and now I'm leaving
To the city where the people are awake to chase a dream that isn't real
And we're 'posed to be something that we're not
Just wanna change and sign our name after the dot

All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me

Now will the sun come up tonight?
Because your eyes they burn so bright
I'm all you've got, when you say that you want it all
You want it all

All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
