Get down with the victim
We both know you need them
You're stuck in the middle
Of all irrelevance
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you've made it (When you've made it)
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
You can't fight the friction, so (Ease it off)
You can't take the pressure, so (Ease it off)
Don't tell me to be strong (Ease it off)
You can't fight the friction
So ease it off

And get into the system
We both know you need one
The tip of the needle
Is taking over you
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you've made it (When you've made it)
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

You can't fight the friction, so (Ease it off)
You can't take the pressure, so (Ease it off)
Don't tell me to be strong (Ease it off)
You can't fight the friction
So, ease it off
Ooh
Why can't you let go?
Like a bird in the snow
This is no place to build your home

You can't fight the friction, so (Ease it off)
You can't take the pressure, so (Ease it off)
Don't tell me to be strong (Ease it off)
You can't fight the friction, so

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
