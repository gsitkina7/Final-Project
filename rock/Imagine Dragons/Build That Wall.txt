I dig my hole, you build a wall
I dig my hole, you build a wall
One day that wall is gonna fall

Gon' build that city on a hill
Gon' build that city on a hill
One day those tears are gonna spill

So build that wall and build it stronger
We'll be there before too long
Gon' build that wall until it's sky
Gon' build that wall until it's done
But now you've got nowhere to run

So build that wall and build it stronger
We'll be there before too long
