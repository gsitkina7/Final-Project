If I were you, I'd run away
Closin' your eyes and count to ten
Bird in the sky, peace in your mind
Closin' the door on yesterday
So many voices
So many voices

If I was me, weight on my back
Feelin' the sun upon my eyes
Where would I turn? What would I burn?
I am a pawn within your hands
So many voices
So many voices
Leavin' my youth, leavin' my truth
Carvin' in my blood into the stone
Lesser of two, either you lose
Or you come out and be alone
So many voices
There's so many choices
So many voices

What do I do? Where do I turn?
Even my screams cease to be heard
Lesser of two
Either you lose
Or you are bound to be alone
So many choices
There's so many noises
So many voices
