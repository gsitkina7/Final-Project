So if you're tired of the
Same old story
C'mon c'mon c'mon
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Yeah, whoo

As soon as you are able
Woman I am willing
To make the break that we
Are on the brink of
My cup is on the table
Our love is spilling
Waiting here for you to
Take and drink of
So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Oh yeah
C'mon baby

I knew it had to happen
Felt the tables turnin'
Got me through my darkest hour
I heard the thunder clappin'
Felt the desert burnin'
Until you poured on me
Like a sweet sunshower

So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah
So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
