Took your heart, took your hand
Promise you all that I had
Hopin' that you understand
Far from a perfect man

'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
Cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair
Lay with me for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

I know you don't understand
The vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
The places that you'd rather be

'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
You're cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you
In our darkest hour
In the dead of the night
I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine
I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more
Than fleetin' thoughts
But you, you are my lifeblood

I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you
