He's never gonna treat you right, I'm sure
He's never gonna kiss you like he should
He's never gonna tuck you in at night
You've always been afraid to settle down
I don't even blame you cause look how
These boys are now

Promise that I'll make you feel
Like we're on a Ferris Wheel
We're always young and innocent
I promise you when things get hard
Our love will be strong enough
I know we'll last, I'm confident
I don't mean to speak in fairy tales
But we have had some heaven and some hell
And I can only speak for myself
And I'm speechless
You've always been afraid to claim this town
And I don't even blame you 'cause look how
These boys are now

Promise that I'll make you feel
Like we're on a Ferris Wheel
We're always young and innocent
I promise you when things get hard
Our love will be strong enough
I know we'll last, I'm confident

'Cause when birds fly south, it's a beautiful thing
Buy a big white house and a diamond ring
Leave it all behind, leave it all behind
'Cause when birds fly south, it's a beautiful thing
Buy a big white house and a diamond ring
Leave it all behind, leave it all behind

Promise that I'll make you feel
Like we're on a Ferris Wheel
We're always young and innocent
I promise you when things get hard
Our love will be strong enough
I know we'll last, I'm confident
I know we'll last, I'm confident
