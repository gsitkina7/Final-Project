If only you, you could see
The darkest place that you could be
Oh, maybe then, you'd understand
From desert heat to cobbled streets
From broken home to the city beat
There's so much more than you could know

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
If I could live a thousand times
If I could make a thousand tries
Oh, maybe then, I'd get it right
The more I see, the more I know
That everyone just wants a show
No, we don't want to see the truth

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

Thief
