I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

Oh, my dear it's a pistol whip to my
Broken head, and the stars are spinning
So I pick one up and put it on my shoulder
Look, look, look
You're a world class case, I'll punch my stomach
All the people see me rolling over
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with the star like I told ya
Pace, pace, pace
Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo

I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

Shadows soar, and breathing heavy
I fall four flights up, halfway steady
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with the star like I told ya
Look, look, look
I'mma take ten steps and close my eyes
Turn around and draw to my surprise
I clutch my heart and scream, "Yeehoo!"
Pace, pace, pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
I don't want to hear the words leave your lips
Love's lyrics leave you missing life
Tell yourself a lie and look through the crosshair
Tie that blindfold tight
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot of rope to burn, lot to learn, whoa
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot of rope to burn, lot to learn, whoa
I don't want to hear you say you believe when you don't

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
