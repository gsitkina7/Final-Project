Got dressed in the morning light
Gotta leave this place far behind
Breathe or die
You say I don't wanna go back
I don't wanna go back
Take me home tonight
Breathe or die

We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And we could try so hard
To fall down, to fall down
Make my way where the sirens sleep
You can take my life but spare my soul
Breathe or die
They say you don't really care, you don't really care
Give me a reason to die
Breathe or die

We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And could we try so hard
To fall down, to fall down

Try to speak my mind to you
Try to tell you what to do
And the end, it's still so lonely
Open up, your blood is bleeding blue
And the seasons bleed right through you
You know, you know I'm here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you

We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And we could try so hard
To fall down, to fall down
