If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on

I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no
Help me out
Yeah, you know you got to help me out
Yeah, oh, don't you put me on the back burn, oh-whoa
You know you got to help me out, yeah
