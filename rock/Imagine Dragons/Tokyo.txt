Baby's got a lot of baggage
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter
Bought a ticket to the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it from the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress
Who was a hostess on the West Coast
Don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Baby's got a lot of baggage

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Get that dynamite
Chick-a-boom on the town tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Get that dynamite

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll

Hey, I come back to where you are
Hey, I come back to where you are
Get that dynamite

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Hey, I come back to where you are
Hey, I come back to where you are

To-okyo, To-okyo
