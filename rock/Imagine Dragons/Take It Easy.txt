Last week, I came to you
I didn't know what to do
Yeah, man, sometimes I lie
But sometimes I can tell the truth
I want my money back
Life's one big heart attack
Yeah, man, my throat is dry
Someday everybody's gonna die

Take it easy on me
I need some lullabies
They tell me heaven's just a lie
Well, I'm not surprised
Tell me that you know
No, you don't
Yeah, you're just like me
Can't we just all hope for the best
Take it еasy
Money don't grow on trees
I'm such a greedy thief
Spend my lifе, I'm huntin'
Keep drinkin' just to find relief
My auntie's pretty cool
She did real well in school
But she still don't know
Where we really go

Take it easy on me
I need some lullabies
They tell me heaven's just a lie
Well, I'm not surprised
Tell me that you know
No, you don't
Yeah, you're just like me
Can't we just all hope for the best
Take it easy

Yeah, take it easy
I don't wanna hear no more of that talk
Not around here, come on
Take it easy on me
I need some lullabies
They tell me heaven's just a lie
Well, I'm not surprised
Tell me that you know
No, you don't
Yeah, you're just like me
Can't we just all hope for the best
Take it easy
Take it easy

La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
