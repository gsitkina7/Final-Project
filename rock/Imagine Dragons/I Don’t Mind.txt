Did your mother like your Sunday dress?
Astrology eradicates
So what, so what?

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
I'm not a lover let me be
For our hearts to bind or be set free
So what, so what?
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, so much, so much

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Your blood, it flows in from the western sea
Your eyes, they shine in through these shaded trees
Oh, I believe in you
These places, they have changed
I don't know anything, but you know me
Oh, you know me
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Oh, not at all
