Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide, oh, no
I'll beat around the bush
I've got nothing but time, oh, no, oh, no

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Now if this is the town, oh this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
Then so be it

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

Oh take my car, oh take my house
I never liked that beat-up motor mouth
And, oh, it looks so warm tonight
Just like a stranger in the candlelight
Take, take, take, take, take, take it all

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

Leave me now
Leave me now
