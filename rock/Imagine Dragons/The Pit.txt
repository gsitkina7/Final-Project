I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

Sitting here all by ourselves, counting all the people
As they pass us by
They gather all around and stare on down into a dark, dark pit
Don't go, please don't go
But they step on in, oh, they fall all in, they walk all over you
'Cause one step at a time, they all walk in a line
Down a false, false hope
I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear

If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

Oh, how can I, how can I convince you to stay?
Where all the flowers bloom, the grass, it sways
And the rain, it pours, and the waves all roar
And the trees they grow
And the fallen crow soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in
Oh, you follow it in
Well, I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear

If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, well, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand
