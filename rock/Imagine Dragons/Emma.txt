Emma stood in front of me
Telling me what I'm supposed to be
Jackie loves to run and hide
Give her love, and she will die
Golly me, oh my, oh my
Cross my heart and hope to die
Bourbon streets and bicycles
Holding you in carnivals

Baby, is my love too old for you?
Baby, is my love too old for you?
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you
Dinner bells and loaded gun
Innocence is bound to run
Enemies and playing fun
But don't you touch that golden sun
Innocence and sentiment
It's all I have, it's paying rent

Baby, is my love too old for you?
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you

Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence

Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
