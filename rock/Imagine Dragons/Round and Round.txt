We are all living the same way, the same way
We are escaping the same way, the same way
Circling (ooh)
We are a part of the same play, the same play
We think we're making our own way, our own way
Circling (ooh)

You don’t have to hold your head up high
Round and round
I won’t run away this time
'Til you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
'Til you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling (ooh)
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience, impatiently
Circling (ooh)

You don’t have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time
'Til you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
'Til you show me what this life is for
All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don’t have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time (hold your head up high)
'Til you show me what this life is for (hold your head up)
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind (hold your head up high)
'Til you show me what this life is for
