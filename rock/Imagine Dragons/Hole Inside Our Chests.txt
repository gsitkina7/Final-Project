Look at the moon
It looks gold
I think it put me in a chokehold, ooh
Alleviate my deep pride
I think it stabbed me in my strong side, ooh
Just when I thought I got it all
You take it all, you take it all, you take it all, ooh

Just give me love
Too much to ask?
I want the one with the night on a flask, ooh
I think my heart, it's full of ooze
My brain is sparking like a burnt out fuse, ooh
I think my heart belongs to the sea
Let it sink to the deep

We are just a few with a hole inside our chests
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Dancing to the drums of the beats inside their hearts
Oh, drown oh, plug me up

We march in sync
My hand in yours
The beat is cleaning out my dirty pores, ooh
You think I'm kidding, I think I'm thinking
I think we all should take a break from lovely singing, ooh

And there's my brain
It's on the floor
It's giving lovers all a brain tour, ooh
And there it is, oh pity me!
Forget this all and let's march out to the sea, ooh

I think my heart belongs to the sea
Let it sink to the deep
We are just a few with a hole inside our chests
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Dancing to the drums of the beats inside their hearts
Oh, drown oh, plug me up

We are just a few with a hole inside our chests
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Dancing to the drums of the beats inside their hearts
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
