All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you

You call me up just to say
You think we're better off this way
Leaves may fall, seasons change
Yet we remain
A year away, a year alone
The tears have fall but we have grown
The sun will rise, the seasons change
And here we are
All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
And we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
Still I am tied to you

I call you up just to say
How much I've thought of you today
The leaves have fall, the seasons change
Yet we remain
A year has passed, our children grow
And in their eyes, I see your soul
The sun grows bright, the rain has gone
And here we are

All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
And still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you

Time will heal our hearts
But were we doomed from the start
Or were we planned in the stars
Or is there any God at all?
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you
