Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Music's for the sad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young
