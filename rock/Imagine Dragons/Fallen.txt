Run for cover
My sense of fear is running thin
Under cover
Just like a candle in the wind

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out
Every morning
I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh, good morning
Will you just wait until I die?

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just going to ride it out

Ohh, tell everybody tell everybody
Ohh, tell everybody we are fallen

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

I just want to take it in
Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again?
We are fallen
