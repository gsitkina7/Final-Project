I love you, you
Running back oh, back to, back to you, you, you, you
I see your anger and hate and I hear ya say, say, say
Let me hear you out at night
And after that I hope you're bulletproof
Then that's okay

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well
 Tomorrow, oh, today here comes the rain
I don't want to, I don't wanna explode, I don't want to explode
When I see your anger awaits
I will never say I 
Say, say, say  but I, but I thought I'm bulletproof
And that's okay

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
Wish you well,  wish you well, I wish you well
