Do you realize it's almost come?
Do you realize it's almost come?
Walkin' for a while until its done
Beatin' on my back and tell it to run
I'm gonna make it into much
I'm gonna breathe until I burst open, open

Lay me down
Lay me down
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight

Do you realize it's almost here?
Do you realize it's almost here?
Walkin' for a while into this year
Beatin' on my back until it's here
I'm gonna make it into much
I'm gonna breathe until I burst open, open

Lay me down
Lay me down

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
Could this be over for too long
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
Could this be over for too long
Save me from myself
Starlight
Covered moonless night
Light my night, starlight
Light the sky
Light our sky, oh
Again, my friends

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
Could this be over for too long
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause when this world is beating down on me
I'll search for light to set me free
Oh, save me, starlight
And when this love is all you used to know
I'll search for light to let you go
Oh, save me, starlight
