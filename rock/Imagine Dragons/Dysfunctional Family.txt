She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

I don't want this body, I don't want this voice
I don't wanna be here, but I guess I have no choice
Just let me live my truth, that's all I wanna do
Baby, you're not broken, just a little bit confused
It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind

Minе is broken, how is yours?
Sure, it helps to hеar the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day..
