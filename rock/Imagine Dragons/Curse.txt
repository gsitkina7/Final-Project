She barely knew your name

He was just a city, she's just a dirt road
But that never meant a thing
Running from the country
She needed out, but he held that diamond ring

'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name
He was such a worry
No need to hurry
Those streets are slick at night
She would never listen
She left it all and headed towards the light
Oh your eyes look tired
But love was all she knew
Screaming out in agony
She gave her life for you

'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name
