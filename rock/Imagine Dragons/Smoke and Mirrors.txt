This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)
All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

Believe
I want to believe

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)
