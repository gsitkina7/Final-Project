I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
That they have stolen from us

'Cause I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it, shouldn't talk about it
The coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
It's caused by absence of you
Suspense is controllin' my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

'Cause I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Why you keep on talkin' 'bout it
No, no don't talk about it
Don't you dare talk about it
