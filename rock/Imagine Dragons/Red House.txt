There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays, oh
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby, oh
In ninety nine and one half days

Wait a minute, something's wrong here
This key won't unlock the door, oh
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
This key won't unlock the door
And I got a bad, bad feeling, oh
That my baby don't live here no more
(On the bass)
Well I might as well go on over yonder, yeah
Back up on the hill
(Now there's something)
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more, oh
I know her sister will!
Take us home, Wayne!


Oh
Oh
Oh, you love me so good
C'mon, one more time
Get it
Oh
