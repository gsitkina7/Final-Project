Oh, it's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
Now the bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breakin' me out
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for Love at First Sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane


Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
