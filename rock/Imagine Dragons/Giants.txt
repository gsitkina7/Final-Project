Take a hit of anything
To escape it all, I'm suffocating
A sharpened blade of reality
Sometimes, I wanna hurt me
I know it's hard to hear, but I'm
Waitin' for the new year
Don't wanna waste my life chasin' white
Try to swim towards the light

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly, I am killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to thе ceiling
Always rock 'n' roll 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'
Now I'm shaking at night, sweating thе sheets out
Grinding my teeth out
But still the world will glamorize it all

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety

If I could leave one thing for you
It's exactly what not to do
I'm so proud of you
Take a look what I've become
Oh, take a look what I've
Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
