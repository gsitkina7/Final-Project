Always be careful, don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T?
Kiss, lights, make news
Open places, question rules
Stop tryin', you vagabond
What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else

So come on boots, oh, walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream (yeah)
Wait, explain, you're zippin' off
Don't let it off so easy
What did you mean?
Always be careful, don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T?
Kiss, lights, make news
Open places, question rules
Stop tryin', you vagabond
What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else

So come on boots, oh, walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing (Ya-hoo)
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream

Oh I don't want to see your face in this broken town
(I don't want to see your face in this broken town)
I'm runnin' down South to bury my head in the ground
(Runnin' down South, bury my head in the ground)
Oh, I don't need money and I don't need you
But if you come around I'm gonna bliggidy loo
Boots, oh walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life (Wanna live my life)
Don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream
