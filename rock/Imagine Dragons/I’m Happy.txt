What's wrong with me?
Is there somebody else inside my head
That doesn't want me to be happy?
I know my rights, I live until I die
I've got this bed
Each night I go to sleep and dream
I'm swimmin' in the deep end
You're my buoy and I'm sinkin'
Life flies by me but I'm thinkin'
You saved my life and now I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around

They tellin' me, that I should love myself
Sometimes I fail
But then you hit me like a whiplash
Yellin' in my corner
She's a wild one, yes, I should warn ya'
Life flies by me every mornin'

You saved my life and now I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around

They tell me to write a paragraph of everything I love about me
Write a paragraph and send it in the mail
To a future me, that's trying desperately to start a family
Teach them to love themself
Teach them to love themself
Teach them to love themself
I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around
I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around

(Happy, happy, happy, happy)
(Happy, happy, happy, happy)
(Ha-)
