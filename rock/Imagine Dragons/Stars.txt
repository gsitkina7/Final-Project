Lost at sea, so unexplored, tomorrow the world goes dark
Bring you home, tell me why
She lives to hear me talk about
Where the dreams, they cry
And hit, oh, high my face for more
The  move just wanna know
She's all I want so 

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you
Set me free from all the fields of all the squinted eyes
Tell me why the sun, it died
Tell me all the lies you hear
About a time when I was young
And all I hear was trying to find

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you

Kiss me when the sun is gone
Hold me in your arms
Tell me why this darkness is a lie upon the stars

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you
