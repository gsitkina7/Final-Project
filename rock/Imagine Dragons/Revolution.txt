You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?

Alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
