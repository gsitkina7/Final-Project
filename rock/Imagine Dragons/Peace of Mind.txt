I had a dream that I lost everything (Everything)
All that I'd worked for was gone
Goodness me (Goodness me)
But I felt the same as I do right now
Everything is meaningless
At least that's how it feels (Feels, real bad)

Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind
I try every time, but can't get no peace of mind (I)
I've got so much to be happy about (Happy about)
I'm always focused on things that amount to nothing
Yeah, I think I'm a little depressed (Depressed, depressed)
Everything is mеaningless
At least that's how it feels (Feels real bad)

Try as I might, I can't gеt no peace of mind
I try every time, but can't get no peace of mind (I)
No, ohh, peace of mind
Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind (I)

But then you came into my life
You made me laugh for the first time
In a real long while

Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind
I try every time, but can't get no peace of mind (I)
No, ohh, peace of mind
Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind (I)
