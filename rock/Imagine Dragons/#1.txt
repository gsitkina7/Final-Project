Could someone take me home where I'm supposed to be?
I'm on my back again, caught up in something
Could someone take me home? I could use a friendly face
Yeah, these leeches got to go
Yeah, I need a safe space

When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
Watching my candle burn, burn
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
These people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one

Yeah, number one, two, three
You've let me down again, why am I surprised?
I'm on my back again, walking in the wind
I know how these things go (Oh)

When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
Watching my candle burn, burn

'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
These people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
Still my number one as all these years go by
Still my number one, I'm still my number—

What do you take me, what do you take me for?
What do you take me for?
Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo
What do you take me, what do you take me for?
Yeah, I've been here through it all
Yeah, I'm still here

'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
And these people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
I don't need no one to believe (Yeah, I know)
When it's all been said and done (When it's all)
I'm still my number one (I know)
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
These people might not see (I know)
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
I'm still my number one
I'm still my number one
