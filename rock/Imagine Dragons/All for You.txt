I get caught in the water, get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river, while the sun burns dim
I get tossed by the ocean, fall deep in the sand
I’m drowned out by the thunder, lost in the land

Is anyone listening?
Is anyone around to see?

That I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go
I’m ready to go
I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go
I’m ready to go

Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body, start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go
Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body, start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go

I said
Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body, start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go
