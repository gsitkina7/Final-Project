I know when my day will come
Go back to the place that I came from
Lookin' back, will I think that I did it right?
I still don't sleep at night
I got these symphonies stuck in my head
And they don't leave
Fillin' up the silence with these notes
I don't want them to go

Ghosts follow me around these days
Haunting my head and house
My mind is crazy loud
But I won't give in to it
Take it all in stride
This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the highеr ground

I've got that golden gun
I was born as the sеventh son
Everything comes with conditions
Everyone's got their dirty dishes
I've got these memories
Stuck in my head, and they won't leave
Filling up my treetops with these crows
I wish that they would go

This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher
This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher ground
Get it, got it, want it
Tell me what to do, and I'm on it
I am the witness
The genesis
The reason
Get it, got it, want it
Tell me what to do and I'm on it
I am the witness, the witness, the witness
(The witness, the witness, the witness)

This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
Bleeding, keep on breathing

Higher ground
Hey, hey
Higher, higher
Higher, higher ground
Higher ground
Hey, hey
Higher, higher
Higher, higher ground
