Rise up this mornin'
Smiled at the risin' sun
Three little birds
Sittin' on my doorstep
They're singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Singing, "this is my message to you"

Singing don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
I'm singing don't worry 'bout a thing
Now don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Rise up this mornin'
Smiled at the risin' sun
Three little birds
Sit by my doorstep
They're singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Singing, "this is my message to you"
This is for you

Singing don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
I'm singing don't worry 'bout a thing
Now don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
One more time now

Singin' don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Singin', don't worry about a thing
Now don't you worry
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
