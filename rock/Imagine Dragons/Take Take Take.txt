You give me love
But then you take it away
And I'm left to search where to hide
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh
Take, take, take
But don't give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
I bang on your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall

You give me headaches
Oh, all I need is a break
From your clever little lies
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh

Take, take, take
But donâ€™t give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
I bang on your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
Ah, ah, ah
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin

Take, take, take
But don't give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
I bang on your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall
