So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot, then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, "Don't you know?" You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
I say, "Don't you know?" You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
Well, I say, "Don't you know?" You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, "Don't you know?" You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on now, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you
