Every move you make
Every breath you take
Every vow you make
Every single day
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every bond you break
Every single day
I'll be watching you
Oh, can't you see?
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every breath you take

Every move you make
Every breath you take
Every vow you make
Every single day
I'll be watching you
