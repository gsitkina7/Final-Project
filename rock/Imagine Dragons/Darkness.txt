I can never leave you when you're lying in the bed
Face to the wall
Eyes locked on the floor
What did you mean by that, what did you mean by that?
Take it as a self invitation
Take it as your own means of salvation
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness
I could never beat it when you needed me the most
The more I try the less you try to come
How could I live like that, how could I live like that?
Take it as a self indication
Take it as your own means of vindication
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
It's too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness
Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
Oh, it is too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Living in the darkness
Please
Living, living in the darkness
