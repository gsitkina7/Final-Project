She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind
Mine is broken, how is yours?
Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day as all the boys would play
Don't you darе be weak, emasculatеd freak
Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense?

It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind

I don't want this body, I don't want this voice
I don't wanna be here, but I guess I have no choice
Just let me live my truth, that's all I wanna do
Baby, you're not broken, just a little bit confused

It's okay to be not okay (I need you here with me)
It's just fine to be out of your mind (I can't do it all alone)
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind (It's okay, out of your mind)
It's okay to be not okay (I need you here with me)
It's just fine to be out of your mind (I can't do it all alone)
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind (It's okay, come on and on and on and on)
