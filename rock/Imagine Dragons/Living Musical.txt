It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about, a sudden attraction
Between two with a few of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds, but it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
Blessed to just bask in your presence, ooh

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream, feelings roll down like thunder
I never met my match, melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble
For the first time in my life I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand I don't know when it's art
When I laugh she must smile, when I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?
And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, whoa
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, be easy on me baby; I'm a sensitive mess
You're a beautiful girl, nothing else, nothing less
Just tell me what you're feeling what I know to be true
And I'll give all that I have, baby, I'll give it all to you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
