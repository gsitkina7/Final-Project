See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
And I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you, oh-no
I can't live with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body's bruised she's got me with
There's nothing to win
And there's nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you, oh-no
I can't live with or without you
Alright we gotta be heard, help me out

Ohh-oh-oh-oh, ohh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh, oh-whoa
Oo-oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo

With or without you
With or without you, oh-no
I can't live with or without you
One more time, here we go
Ohh-oh-oh-oh, ohh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh, oh-whoa
With or without you
