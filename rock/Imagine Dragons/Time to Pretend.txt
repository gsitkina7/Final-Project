I'm feeling rough, I’m feeling raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I’ll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Put down and that will be the end
We're fated to pretend
I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my father, miss my mother
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start anew
The models will have children, we’ll get a divorce
We’ll have some more models, everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We’re fated to pretend

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
