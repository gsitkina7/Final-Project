One day, I'll change my ways
Till then, I'm stuck in this space
Shut down and hiding my face
Tuned out and losing my faith

Stand up, tired of being the victim
You only on the outs, if you with them
Only hurts if you give 'em credence (Ah)
Give 'em reasons (Ah)
They're not better than you
They're just a figment of imagination
There are times when I don't like myself
I believe all the things that they say about me ('Bout me)
I wanna love myself, just likе everyone еlse
But there are times when I don't like myself

This life is beating me down
But karma is coming around
Tongue-tied, and you got the best of me
A nightmare that's filling my dreams

Stand up, tired of being a victim
You only on the outs if you with 'em
Only hurts if you give 'em credence (Ah)
Give 'em reasons (Ah)
They're not better than you
They're just a figment of imagination

There are times when I don't like myself (There are times)
I believe all the things that they say about me ('Bout me)
I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
But there are times when I don't like myself
I-da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
I-da-da, da-da, I don't like myself

I-I-I'll walk through fire for this
I will be the one to turn this car around
'Cause it's headed for disaster
No happily ever after
And I've got so much more to live for
Than what you think of me

There are times when I don't like myself (There are times)
I believe all the things that they say about me ('Bout me)
I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
But there are times when I don't like myself

I-da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
I-da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
I-da, I-da, I-da, I don't, I-da, li-li-li-li-like myself
I-da, like myself
I-da, like myself
I-da, like myself
