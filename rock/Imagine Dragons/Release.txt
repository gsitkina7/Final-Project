Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting sun
Heaven talks, but not to me
Cause Heaven knows that nothing good comes free

Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks, but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be

Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

I'll take your word, cause after all
You've never lied, oh not at all
But look at me, oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
