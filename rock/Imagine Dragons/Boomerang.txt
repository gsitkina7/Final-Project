How many lies do we have to tell?
To keep from saying, that I wish you well?
How many times I said I'm movin’ on?
How many times that false alarm goes off? (Goes off)
Goes off? (Goes off)
I know I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I’m bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You’re my boomerang, boomerang
How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it out, is it worth it now?
Should we go ahead?
Or should we turn around?
I know I’ll see you tomorrow

'Cause I’m bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin’ you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean that it is wrong
Everything that we've been working on, working on so long
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You're my boomerang, boomerang (Ooh)
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boome-boome-boomerang-rang
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang-rang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang-rang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
