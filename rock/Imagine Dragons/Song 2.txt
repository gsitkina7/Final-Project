Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, c'mon!
(Woohoo!) When I hear heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) When, I'm comin' up easy
All of the time when I get that way, it ain't easy
But nothin' else is!
Woohoo!

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

(Woohoo!) When I hear heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) When, I'm comin' up easy
All of the time when I get that way-zay
But nothin' else is!

Woohoo!
(Now) woohoo!
Woohoo!
