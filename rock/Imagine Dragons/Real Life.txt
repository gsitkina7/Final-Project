She says that the world is a broken mess
And it's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Oh, every single time

And no, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop

So I said, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
She prays on her knees as the towers fall
To a god she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs will blow (Ooh)
She says, "How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch?"
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I fake it for the day, oh, everything will be okay

But no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop

So I said, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold to
Only thing that's real to me is you

"Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, hey (Real life, hey)
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
