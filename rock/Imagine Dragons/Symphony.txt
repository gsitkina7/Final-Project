Ever since I was young (Coming up, coming up)
Always marching to a drum (Bra-da-dum, Bra-da-dum)
Always focused on me (One one, one one)
Now I wish that I could hold someone (Someone)

So tell my mom, I love her
Call my baby sister
Should've hugged and kissed her
'Cause life is just a mystery
And it's gone before you know it
So if you love me, won't you show it?
'Cause this life is one big symphony
This night is one for you and me
I'm the strings and you're the timpani
You're my constant tambourine
This life is one big symphony
So glad I've got you next to mе
I'm the chords and you're the mеlody
This life's one big symphony

She was the piano
I'm the xylophone
You can have the trumpet
I'm the saxophone

Life is skipping rope (Keep going, keep going)
Finding solace in a note (Dote dote, dote dote)
Had to struggle when I was broke (So low, so low)
Writing music just to cope (No hope, no hope)

Yeah, life is just perspective
Laughing when you've wrecked it
Smiling when you kept it together
You weathered the storm
At the end of the play, you sang all the way
Doesn't matter how off-key if you did it your way
This life is one big symphony
This night is one for you and me
I'm the strings and you're the timpani
You're my constant tambourine
This life is one big symphony
So glad I've got you next to me
I'm the chords and you're the melody
This life's one big symphony

Would you care if I played you the flute?
See, it's my favorite one because it's so delicate and beautiful
I pull out the trombone if it's more suitable
Wanna make you smile
It's been a little while since I've seen the white of your teeth
Been a hard year
Lucky the guitar's here


Life is just one big symphony
This life is one big symphony
This night is one for you and me
I'm the strings and you're the timpani
You're my constant tambourine
This life is one big symphony
So glad I've got you next to me
I'm the chords and you're the melody
This life's one big symphony
