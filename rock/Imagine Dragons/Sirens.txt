Fall right down to the bottom
Boy with a motto
Stay, but I oughta leave, and trust me, my heart bleeds
I feel everything, I
Drip, drop, drink out of the bottle
Boy with a heart of gold, get run over by heaven knows what
Weary soldier, I get older, life gets colder

Sometimes I get a little bit scared at night
I get a little preoccupied
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind
I just wanna be good again
I wanna make it to the end
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind
Autumn, stuck in thе grotto
Been tryin' for the lottery but nevеr win
My heart bleeds, I feel everything, I
Drop, drop, way down to the bottom
Boy with a heart of gold, get run over by heaven knows what
Weary soldier, I get older, life gets colder

Sometimes I get a little bit scared at night
I get a little preoccupied
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind
I just wanna be good again
I wanna make it to the end
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind

The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind
Sirens, sirens
Sirens, sirens
Drowning me out, drowning me out
