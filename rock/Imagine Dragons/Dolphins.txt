There's dolphins over my head
Swimmin' through my conscience
My working days are over
Heading out to make my way
When darkness is around us
We'll dive into the cavern
Our working days are over
Heading out to make my way

It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us meet
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you
My faith is at adolescent
I've learned myself a lesson
If I hold myself higher
I think it'd get much higher

It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us be
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you

I fill my lungs with you, ooh-ooh
I fill my lungs with you, ooh-ooh-oh
I fill my lungs with you

It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us meet
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungsâ€”
It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us meet

This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you
With you, you, you
