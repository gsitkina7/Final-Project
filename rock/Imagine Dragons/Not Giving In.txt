I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in

Well, it's time to start the show
I lost my heart and lost my soul
And now it's time that you won't know
I lost my mind and lost my soul
Mm, not giving in
I'm not giving in
Ooh, I'm not giving in
Ooh, I'm not giving in, yeah

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in

Waste my time which makes things worse
Lost in mine, my love is cursed
Time to make these things feel right
Woah, let's start this show for one last time

Oh, I'm not giving in
(Not giving in)
Not giving in

Oh, not giving in

Not giving in, oh

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in, no
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in, no
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in
Not giving in
I'm not giving in
Not giving in, ooh
Not giving in, ooh
Oh, I've gotta be stronger
Oh, I've gotta be stronger
