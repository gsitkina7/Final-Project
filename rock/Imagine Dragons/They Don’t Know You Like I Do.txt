Hum, dum-dum-dum, dum-dum
Hum-dum, hum-dum, dum

He was never gonna make it
Every pill he found, he'd take it
Always on the edge of breakdowns
Keepin' it together somehow
Just another cold November
You called me but I didn't answer
I was so oblivious
Now, I'm askin' for forgiveness
For every single time I failed you
I'm feelin' like it's me that killed you
Rememberin' the time they jumped you
And I was too scared to help you
Looking back, I can't erase it
Guess it's time to face it
You never seemed to know how to let it all go
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do

Everybody saw you smilin'
That you were always good at hiding
You were always asking questions so you wouldn't draw attention
Everyone who used you
They never really knew you
You're always showin' up for everybody but yourself
See, I wish I could take it back
Change the future and erase the past
Grab the bullet out and pull you back
I promise that I'd save your life like you saved mine
But now it's far too late for that
And all I have is your story left to tell
So, let me tell it
Let me tell

Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
