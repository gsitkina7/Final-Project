What can I say?
Free will is blind today
The choice that you made
Is a not a road that I would take
To use and betray
Simple as a power play
Not far away
With tears that go unexplained now
Oh my love
Can it be?
I'm falling from your grace with me now
Oh more than ever
I still remember
They say
It's just a passing phase
No more like a game
Problems of the human race
Goes right to your brain
Caught down in a hidden place
With no sense of shame
The secrets there and you can't erase
Oh my love
Can it be?
I'm falling from your grace with me
Now more than ever
I still remember your name
When do you think you can tell me?
How long do you think I can wait?
Oh no I said
I thought I never said I was sorry
Now don't you fall on your face now with livin' with it
The storm is comin ‘again
I, I sense the shiverin’ down
You thought you had it, ah
But thought you had it figured it out
But you do not even care
How could it be?
You’re falling from your grace with me
And now, now my love
I ask
I ask myself what I believin’
‘Cause now more tha ever I still remember your name
