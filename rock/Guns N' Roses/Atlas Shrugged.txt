Why should I try and judge the things they say
That just won’t budge, I’m letting go
And sheltered from the blind
So you managed to be kind
But still enough to show me how to keep it together
When I’m crying out in vain
No matter who’s to blame
There’s still a ways to go
So, if you ask me to believe your heart won’t follow you
It’s got a mind of its own
When it says “Run” and the road gets rough
And you’re the one
Whose shoulders just ain’t wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they’ve had enough

I’d be the last to say, "don’t follow your heart"
But there’s more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you know
What you’ve shown
Than that we know you understand

It's not the thing, if I were you
I would say all that I do
To be half as strong, or still belong
You should take the time
To look back at what you find
Your heart misadventures

When it says “Run” and the road gets rough
And you’re the one
Whose shoulders just ain’t wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they’ve had enough
I’d be the last to say, "don’t follow your heart"
But there’s more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you've known
What you’ve shown
Than that we know you understand
In fact, I never said, "don’t follow your heart"
If I thought that's what it takes to make a man
From what you've known
All that you’ve been shown
Gee, even now I'd hope you'd understand
