Do you remember who did it?
Who did that to you...
Who would do this to you?
Who would do this to you? To the young!
Who would do that to me, boy?
Up to abuse, in fact you knew them
Who wants to lose?
To lose
Do you?
I've got hopes and dreams, and I must feel bolder
My hopes, my dreams have died
Now I rest my hate in the rumors as they're pushin' through
There's a child now chained to the bed now
To me it's time I'm always workin' and I'm gonna get out
I think it's high time you should fuckin' die, child
I think this time you've broken everything inside
I won't be ever satisfied
This is why, baby, you know I got you

Do you remember who did it?
Who did, that to you...
Who would do this, to you?
Who would do this to you? To the young!
Who would that to me, boy?
Up to abuse, in fact we knew them
Who wants to lose?
To lose
Do you?
