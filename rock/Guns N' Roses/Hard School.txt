All cautions made
Every chance was given
No effort spared
To save what we had
All in good faith
I would not hesitate
To extend myself
And lend you my hand
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
As tempers fade
And lies forgiven
No cause embraced
Could break what we had
In its place
A storm is lifting
I would've thought you could be more of a man
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that wеre true, it wouldn't matter anyway
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to bе a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
You had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
You had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
