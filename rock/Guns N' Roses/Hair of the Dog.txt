Give me a little bit of volume on this

You're a heart-breaking soul shaker
I've been told about you
Steamroller, midnight shoulder
A-what they've been saying must be true

Red hot mama, velvet charmer
I say time's going to pay your dues
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch

Talking jive and poison ivy
You aren't going to cling to me
Man taker, born faker
I ain't so blind I can't see

Red hot mama, velvet charmer
I say time's going to pay your dues

Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch


Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
