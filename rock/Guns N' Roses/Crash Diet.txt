Crash diet of reds an' ludes
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose
In your one-track mind now, where's that leave you?

Drink an' drive, white lightning faster, baby
Takin' your last ride, now
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Sorry, you took mother's car, now
Tears in my eyes, baby, please don't go
You've had one too many, havin' one for the road
Fresh from detox, fresh from jail
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me through hell

Drink an' drive, white lightning faster, ooh
Takin' your last ride, yeah
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Sorry, you took mother's car, now

Too soon for those who didn't mean it
Too late for the pressure and blame
Too bad for those who don't believe it
Ruby street still calls your name


Itchy trigger finger an' the race to be alive
Smokin' a cig while you drink an' drive
With no control of your life ahead
You're never going to see it if you wind up dead
Drink an' drive, white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Drink an' drive, white lightning, baby
It's always on your mind
Push it to the limit baby, do it one more time

Break it down, ooh, break it down
Somethin's changin', somethin's breakin'
You gotta be a brother of your family
Maybe one more time we'll make it
Sweet history, oh
If you don't care about yourself
Would you please leave me alive
Oh, you're gonna, you're gonna drink an' drive
Oh yeah
