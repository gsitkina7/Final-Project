Perhaps I was wrong
When I didn't see you
Hay hay
Perhaps I was wrong
Hay
When I don't believe you
But I wanna know how it feels
What it is to be you
I've been so upset
Harbouring this hate for days
My sense of rejection
Hay hay
Is no excuse for my behaviour
Hay
You pulled the gun
Hay hay
That shot and crucified my saviour
Now he is no more
And I am without you
Just like I was before
The way I used to be
What a weight upon your shoulders
That you don't need
My heart bleeds for me
(Save me) Shine like more than a bomb you are
You're all alone now
(Save me) You could start a fight you know you were begging for
You're all alone
(Save me) So talk to the ones that you once ignored
You're all alone
(Save me) Used to be a little crazy now there's so much more
You're all alone
Oh
Perhaps I was wrong
When I didn't see you
Hay hay
Perhaps I was wrong
Hay
When I don't believe you
But I wanna know how it feels
What it is to be you
I've been so upset
Harbouring this hate for days
What a weight upon your shoulders
That you don't need
My heart bleeds for me
(Save me) Shine like more than a bomb you are
You're all alone now
(Save me) You could start a fight you know you were begging for
You're all alone
(Save me) So talk to the ones that you once ignored
You're all alone
(Save me) Used to be a little crazy now there's so much more
You're all alone
