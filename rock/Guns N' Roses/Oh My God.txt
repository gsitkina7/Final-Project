It's not as you're thinking or as you've imagined
To live in the shade of beliefs that were fashioned
To leave you in slavery and drain out your soul
But what can I do when there's so many liars
That crawl through your veins like millions of spiders
That seek out their victims and who is the wiser, watch out
Gotcha

Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wanted to know
So give it away like they're not gonna fuck you
How much can you pay if they come back and haunt you
To broadcast your feelings and cause you to suffer
You're starting to bleed, they don't discover
Before it's too late, what will you offer
In ways of a healing, oh, I'm so confused
Abused, misused

Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
'Cause nobody wanted to know

Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than a strong compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than the last compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shadows
If only you had let me know

And they won't give in 'cause they know what they're after
A kick in the face, like it's all that would matter
Oh

Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to murder and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
'Cause nobody wanted to know

Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than a good compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, well it's on with the show
Like the tides out on the ocean
The waves already set in motion
The only one in the game who's lost is you
