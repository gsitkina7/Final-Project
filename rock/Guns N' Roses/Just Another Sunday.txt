I know you've been dreaming about the times in our lives
But I've been screaming in my bed late at night
A space a little, little and your stack of pain
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch your eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay

Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yeah, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yeah
There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid
Don't think your second chance will break around the bend
Because hearts don't always share love or the person on the other end
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch your eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya

Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yeah, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yeah

Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me
Because felling the same pain makes half the luxury
Take a walk away won't end the carousel
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay
Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yeah, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yeah
