Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find

That it's alright, it's alright

Where to go? Where to see?
It's always been that way and it can never be
But it's alright, yeah, it's alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn

That it's alright, it's alright

Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through

But it's alright, it's alright

Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find

That it's alright, it's alright
