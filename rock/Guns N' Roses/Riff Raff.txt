You see it on television every day
Hear it on the radio
It ain’t humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
Boss man trying to tell me
Beginning of the end
Saying it'll bend me
Too late my friend

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Now I'm the kind of guy that keeps his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kicking me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain’t done nothin' wrong
I'm just having fun
