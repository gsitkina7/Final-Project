This one's for you, Johhny

It doesn't pay to try
All the smart boys know why
It doesn't mean I didn't try
I just never know why
It's isn't 'cause I'm all alone
Oh, baby, you're not home
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone
It's so restless, as I am
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense
Down inside my bones
And even though it don't show
Those scars aren't so old

Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try
Don't try

You're just a bastard kid
And you got no name
Could you live with me?
Go on and say
And even though it don't show
Those scars aren't so old

Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try
Don't try
Johnny, you're me, yeah, your memory
I want to put my arms around your memory

I can't try
I can't try
Don't try
Come on
LAMF
Like a mother fucker
Yo, Johnny, what color were her eyes?
Oh, she was wearing shades?
Fuck yeah
