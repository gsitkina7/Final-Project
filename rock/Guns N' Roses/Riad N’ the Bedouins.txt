Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

Riad and the Bedouins had a plan and thought they'd win
But I don't give a fuck 'bout them 'cause I am crazy

Oh, my salvation and all my frustrations
Caught in the lies, no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

Riad and the Bedouins and that's a war that you can't win
But I have had enough of them and who blame me
Sands of time and desert winds, Nomads and Barbarians
I won't bend my will to them, you aggravate me

Oh, my salvation and all my frustrations
Caught in the lies, no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell
Ooh, sweet salvation, like all my frustrations
Caught up in lies, no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh

Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

Oh, sweet salvation and all my frustrations
Caught in the lies if you had wove so well
Somewhere in time, then only I could tell, oh

Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Riad and the Bedouins (Oh-oh, oh)
Had a plan and thought they'd win  (Oh-oh, oh)
Riad and the Bedouins (Oh-oh, oh)
Crossed the line and lost again  (Oh-oh, oh)
