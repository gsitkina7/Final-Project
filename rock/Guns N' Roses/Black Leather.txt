Ooh, ooh, ooh

Well, she's all geared up, walking down the street
And I can feel the slime, dripping down her sleeve

Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Ooh, ooh

Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home

Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do

Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore
I never should've asked for...

Black leather
Black leather
Ooh, black leather
Ow, black leather

And you can try to hide, but you won't get far
You can let her in, and you'll start again
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do

Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore
I never should've asked for...

Black leather
Oooh, Black leather
Ow, black leather
Ow, black leather

Ooh, ooh
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Mmmm
