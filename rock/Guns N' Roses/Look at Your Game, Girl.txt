Whenever?
1, 2, 3, 4

There's a time for living
Time keeps on flying
Think you're loving, baby
And all your doin' is crying

Can you feel
Are those feelings real?
Look at your game, girl
Look at your game, girl
What a mad delusion
Living in that confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can you ever live without the game?
The sad, sad game
Mad game
Just to say love's not enough
If it can't be true
Oh, you can tell those lies, baby
But you're only fooling you

Can you feel
Are those feelings real?
Look at your game, girl
Go on, look at your game, girl

If'n you can't feel
And those feelings ain't real
Then you better stop trying
Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying
Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying
That's the game
Sad, sad game
Mad game
Sad game
Thanks, Charles
