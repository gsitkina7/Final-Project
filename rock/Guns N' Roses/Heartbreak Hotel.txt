Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of the lonely street
It's called Heartbreak Hotel and you know

It gets so lonely
So lonely, lonely
I get so lonely I could die
And although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
Where broken hearted lovers
Do cry away their gloom and you know

You make me so lonely baby
I get so fucking lonely
I get so lonely I could die

Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back

You make me so fucking lonely baby
I get so fucking lonely
I get so lonely I could die

Hey now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
