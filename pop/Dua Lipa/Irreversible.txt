It's never gonna wash away
Are we sinners or are we saviours?
Regret the day I heard your name
And your array of bad behaviour

If I could, if I could walk away from you
If I could, if I could

But I'm hung up on your touch
Irreversible now, baby
Nowhere left to run
Irreversible now, baby
Stop, there's a devil in us
Addicted to love
No matter how hard that I fight he will never be undone
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)
Once it starts, it never stops
I need you here to feed my craving
But maybe we should separate
Go different ways
We both need saving

If I could, if I could walk away from you
If I could, if I could

But I'm hung up on your touch
Irreversible now, baby
Nowhere left to run
Irreversible now, baby
Stop, there's a devil in us
Addicted to love
No matter how hard that I fight he will never be undone
Irreversible, it's over

Untie the knots in my heart-strings
Let me go
Untie the ropes, let my heart see
Irreversible
Yeah, you're deep, you're deep under my skin
Let me go
I'm weak when you leave, my demon
Irreversible
If I could, if I could walk away from you
If I could, if I could, hmm

Hung up on your touch
Irreversible now, baby
Nowhere left to run
Irreversible now, baby
Stop, there's a devil in us
Addicted to love
No matter how hard that I fight he will never be undone
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)

Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)
