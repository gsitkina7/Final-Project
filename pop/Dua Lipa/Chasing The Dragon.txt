Met a boy and he told me
That life gon' burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won’t know what you’re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I’m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin' out of that suitcase
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"

I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

Another thing that he told me
"It’s gonna be a long, long daylight"
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
I’ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin' the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin' out of my suitcase

He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

No matter what he said to me
I’m gonna be running free, ooh
I just wanna fly, you see
Ain’t nothing stopping me
Ooh

Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
’Cause you know that
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
