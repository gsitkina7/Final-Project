It's never my intention to start a fight
What do you want from me?
I guess it took me awhile to realize
That nothing comes for free

Can't always put my attention on you
Don't mean I'm giving up, don't mean you're not enough
Don't put me in the position to choose
'Cause I will call your bluff
And I don't call that love
'Cause I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, out of my head

Let's do the talking after, don't waste no time
I'll give you everything
Why are we looking for answers?
Wrong or right, just spend the night with mе

I'll put all my attention on you
No, I ain't givin' up
This is more than enough, ah
Don't put mе in the position to lose
And you can call my bluff
But I don't call that love

'Cause I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, out of my head
Just hold me close, don't let me go
I can't give you more than me
It's late at night with you by my side
There's a thing I realized lately
That I, that I, that I

That I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head
'Cause I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, out of my head
