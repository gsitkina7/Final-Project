Stayin' up 'til the A.M
Call you out on all your bullshit
Whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff
It was sweet before the fall
You and I got comfortable quick
But whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff

You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong
If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

When you're thinking of the end
You're only hearin' me say, "I love ya"
You don't hear the door you slammed after
You remember all the good stuff

You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong

If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number
(Wrong number)
(Wrong number)

If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (You got the, you know that you got the)
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, boy, na-na-na-na)
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number
