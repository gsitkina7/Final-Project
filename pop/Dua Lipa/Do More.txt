Look at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
What's a day without a risk?
Do it differently
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
(I wanna do) More
(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

Finally I can see what my heart needs now
Hold my hand, dance with me, we can paint this town
What are we waiting for?
Time to live out loud (Eh-eh-ah-eh)

If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby
I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
(I wanna do) More
(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
(I wanna do) More
(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
