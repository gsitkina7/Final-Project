What are we waiting for?
Are you in or out?
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Hold my hand
Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
What's a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be
(Eh-eh-ah-eh)

All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby
I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yourY
(I wanna, wanna be) yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
