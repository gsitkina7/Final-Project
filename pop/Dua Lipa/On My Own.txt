Nine-to-five in London town
I know I'm ready
They talk about my dreams
Here I'm in love already
Thirteen now, let's move out
The parents house, let's go alone
Fifteen then, and since then, I never look back home

In a world of my own
I'm in the danger zone
Living in the madness, got no time for sadness
God, you're so loud
I couldn't hear my mouth
Living with the motion, no control
Just devotion
I won't ever stop 'til I touch the sky
Whoa, whoa
I won't stand alone 'til I win the fight
Whoa, whoa
'Cause I've been on my own, I've been here alone
And I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
Too long

Bright city lights, they're shining bright
They're falling on me
I'm drawn in like a firefly, can't see so clearly
The music good, the trees I was smoking heavy all night
Through eighteen now, don't look down
Dizzy heights for you now

In a world of my own
I'm in the danger zone
Living for the high life, never have to think twice
God, you're so loud
I couldn't hear my mouth
Living in the fast lane, this could be a game change
I won't ever stop 'til I touch the sky
Whoa, whoa
I won't stand alone 'til I win the fight
Whoa, whoa
'Cause I've been on my own, I've been here alone
And I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long

I'm in the city light, we yell our lines
If we can't fight late, then we doublin' our fines
(Double, double)
I'm gettin' money, but I'm doublin' my mind
When I was gettin' it, I would double up on the credit
But now a fool gonna want a bath with it
Do a song, have a joke, have a laugh with it
(Laugh with it)
I ain't out here sayin' what it's gonna be
No way, 'cause I'm back where I wanna be
Heatwave will (Will)
I'm mentally ill (Ill)
Life, it looks good, but it's fallin' uphill
You're gettin' greedy
When you forget the mil' (Yes)
Forget the pills, but remember bills
Fill this hole in this sky like a parachute
I had a rugged heart when I never hollowed you
So when I had another you
I was like "Oh, god, gotta work hard
Laugh when it's underused"
'Cause I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I've been on my own for too long (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I've been on my own, I've been here alone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I've been on my own for too long
