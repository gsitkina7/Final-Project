Fill me up
So close I've got you face to face
Playing rough
Can't help it when you say my name

I wanna feel you closer
I'm losing my composure
I'm drowning in a pool of adrenaline
I wanna feel your thunder
I'll let you take me under
Shakes and shivers riding up my skin
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight

Silhouettes
And shadows moving in our bed
Take a guess
Tell me what you think happens next

I wanna feel you closer
I'm losing my composure
I'm drowning in a pool of adrenaline
I wanna feel your thunder
I'll let you take me under
Shakes and shivers riding up my skin

Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight
Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side
Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side
Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side
Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side

Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight
