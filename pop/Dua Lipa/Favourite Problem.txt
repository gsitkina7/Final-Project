Sippin' on that purple lean
Gangsta boy got me so mean
Come, let’s get a little wilder
Let's wait till the dark gets lighter
Can you spark me up your last cigarette?
I promise you, you'll never forget
What it feels to be living larger
Baby, party harder

My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

I'll kiss all the ink on your neck
'Cause baby, you do it, and you do it the best
Light up, let's get a little louder
Hold me for a little longer
I love it when you whisper in my ear
Tell me things I always wanna hear
You're the medicine, doctor
Skin on skin, softer

My heart's never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you

Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let it all down, down, down, down
Let me stay high, high, high, high
Never gonna drown, drown, drown
Never say goodbye, bye, bye, bye

Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
I'll be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

Favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
