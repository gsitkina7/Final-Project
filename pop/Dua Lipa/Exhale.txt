Pressure buildin', put that on me
Time to finish what we started
Give me what I always wanted
Mirror, mirror, tell me something

You been holdin' on and on for way too long
The beat is heated up, the bass go boom
You been workin' double time to catch your breath
The tempo speeded up but don't stop yet
You need to, you need to exhale
So let everything go (Let it go, yeah)
Baby, you in control
You need to, you need to exhale
So let everything go (Let it go, yeah)
Baby, you in control

Don't stop, keep it goin'
Lights on, lights off, I'm still glowin'
Confidence I'm overflowin'
Voices tell me, "Keep your focus"

You been holdin' on and on for way too long
The beat is heated up, the bass go boom
You been workin' double time to catch your breath
The tempo speeded up but don't stop yet

You need to, you need to exhale
So let everything go (Let it go, yeah)
Baby, you in control
You need to, you need to exhale
So let everything go (Let it go, yeah)
Baby, you in control
Watch me do it, watch me own it
I know I got it
Keep on movin', keep on goin'
'Cause if you want it

You need to, you need to exhale
So let everything go
Baby, you in control
You need to, you need to exhale (Breathe)
So let everything go (Breathe, yeah)
Baby, you in control

You need to, you need to exhale
