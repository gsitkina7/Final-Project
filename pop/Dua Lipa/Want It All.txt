Look at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
What's a day without a risk?
Do it differently
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

Oh, I want it all (Hey)
I'm talking 'bout everything I've ever dreamed of
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I want it all
(Oh, I want it) All
(Oh, I want it, want it) All
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

Finally I can see what my heart needs now
Hold my hand, dance with me, we can paint this town
What are we waiting for?
Time to live out loud (Eh-eh-ah-eh)

If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby
Oh, I want it all (Hey)
I'm talking 'bout everything I've ever dreamed of
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I want it all
(Oh, I want it) All
(Oh, I want it, want it) All
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

Oh, I want it all (Hey)
I'm talking 'bout everything I've ever dreamed of
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I want it all
(Oh, I want it) All
(Oh, I want it, want it) All
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
