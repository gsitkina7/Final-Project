Hey, hey

After a few drinks, I start thinking about what we had
It gets complicated in my head
In my bed, in my 
And at the parties, nobody seems to care
It's like I'm not there

And I just want you to know
One, two
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do

To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

When I left ya, I left hidden treasure
'Causе now no one can measure its prеssure
And I don't know what to do
Do I come back with the pride that I have left?
'Cause I know you were the best

But I just want you to know
One, two

That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

Now I've come undone
And if I could turn back time, I'd choose you
I wish you were mine
I didn't know then, but now I do

That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do

To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you
