Hey, hey

After a few drinks
I started to thinking 'bout what we had
It gets complicated in my head, in my bed, am I mad?
Yeah
And at the parties, nobody seems to care
It's like I'm not there
And I just want you to know
One, two
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

When I left ya, I left hidden treasure
'Cause now no one can measure, it's pressure
And I don't know what to do
Do I comeback with the pride that I have left?
'Cause I know you were the best
But I just want you to know
One, two
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

Now I've come undone
And if I could turn back time I'd choose you
I wish you were mine, I didn't know then but now I do

That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
