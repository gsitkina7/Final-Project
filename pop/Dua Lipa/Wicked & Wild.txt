We are runaways, so we misbehave
And your mama warned you to stay away
I don't wanna leave your humanity
But we were fallin' in water and then we found the sea
There's just two of us, and it's true of me
And the lost by the society
Had to sacrifice, had to roll the dice
Had to make our way through hell to get to paradise

Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
(Fueled by desire)
Fueled by desire tonight (Fueled by desire)
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Fueled by desire tonight

It's a ritual, they call us criminals
Even back in school, individual
You don't wanna see our reality
'Cause the only thing you see in us is enemy

Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
(Fueled by desire tonight)
Fueled by desire
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
(Fueled by desire tonight)
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
