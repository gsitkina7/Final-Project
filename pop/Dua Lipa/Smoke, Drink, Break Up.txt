See, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I don't like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and don't have to think no more
Get high as a plane
'Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we don't, we gon' start fighting again
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Let's go

I've gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I've gotta be outta my head to be still with you
See, I love you but I don't like that
Keep leaving, coming right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And calling each other out our names like bitches and n-
Arguing over all that small shit, keeps getting bigger
Corona out the kitchen

So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah
Boy, we only get along when we high
Either we smoking, oh

So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drinking or high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Leggo
