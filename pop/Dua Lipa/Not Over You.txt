Lately, baby, my mind's fixed on you
At the strangest time
Just left another version of you
'Cause he wasn't right

Same shit, different day
Tears on aeroplanes
But I can't find my way to you
I taped my broken heart
And it's been fine so far
But I can feel it getting loose
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over the way you move
The way you do the things you do
I'm tryna be strong, I'm tryna move on
But I keep thinking, "What's the use?"
Baby, I'm not over you
I'm not over you

I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over you, I'm not over you

Never know what you'vе got 'til it's gone
Ain't that the truth?
Baby, right now I am bettеr off alone
'Til I can figure it through
Figure it through, through, through

Same shit, different day
You see nothing's changed
Not even how I feel for you
I taped my broken heart
And it's been fine so far
But I can feel it getting loose
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over the way you move
The way you do the things you do
I'm tryna be strong, I'm tryna move on
But I keep thinking, "What's the use?"
Baby, I'm not over you
I'm not over you

It was him in my bed
But it was you in my head
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
And we know that night after night
I just sit up and cry
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you

'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over the way you move
The way you do the things you do
I'm tryna be strong, I'm tryna move on
But I keep thinking, "What's the use?"
Baby, I'm not over you

It was him in my bed
But it was you in my head
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
And we know that night after night
I just sit up and cry
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over you
I'm not over you
