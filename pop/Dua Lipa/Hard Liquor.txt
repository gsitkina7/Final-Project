Hard liquor, playing games
Just say my name, I wanna see you later
Pour me one, 'cause he fooled me twice
Push me down, I know I'm no better
I'm not here for ya, not here for ya
Not here for ya, no, no, no, no

Huh, who do you think you are?
I've heard it all before, just let this bass-line roll
Who, just me and you?
I'll wait for tonight, while the strobe-lights so bright
Huh, who do you think you are?
I've heard it all before, just let this bass-line roll
Who, just me and you?
I'll wait for tonight, while the strobe-lights so bright
