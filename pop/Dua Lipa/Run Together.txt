Broken and focused, not looking for faces
Had no expectations, I was done with all of that
Green eyes, electric, contagious connection
When I least expect it, I forgot it all for that

(Ah-ooh)
I'm in Heaven when I'm where you are (Ooh)
You see me like no one before (Ooh)
I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I’ve never been this real with somebody else (Somebody еlse)
I thought I knew love 'til thе moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
There's no compromise 'cause we see eye-to-eye
You came down like a light
Now we run together
(Run to-, run to-, run together)

I can't explain it 'cause I've never felt it
What I said, I meant it, and with you

I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I've never ever been this real with somebody else (Somebody else)

I thought I knew love 'til the moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
There's no compromise 'cause we see eye-to-eye
You came down like a light
Now we run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)
I'm in Heaven when I'm where you are
You see me like no one before (Ooh)
Giving me all of the things that I didn't think were possible, impossible

I thought I knew love 'til the moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
There's no compromise 'cause we see eye-to-eye
You came down like a light
Now we run together

I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I’ve never ever been this real with somebody else
I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I’ve never ever been this real with somebody else

I thought I knew love 'til the moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
(Loving better, loving better)
