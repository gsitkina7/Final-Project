In the arms of someone who can set you free
But you think of me
You know that I will never give you what you need
But that's no relief

If you wanna move on
Here’s what I suggest, ooh

Pretend I don't exist
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Make you lay awake and wish
That you never felt something as good as this
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)
Turn me into someone that you never knew
If it gets you through
‘Cause making you forget ain’t something I can do
It’s gotta come from you

When you wanna move on
Here’s what I suggest, ooh

Pretend I don't exist
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Make you lay awake and wish
That you never felt something as good as this
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)

If I thought it’d help ya
I would pray for you
But I can’t be the one
To reach out and pull you through

If you wanna move on
Here's what I suggest, ooh
Pretend I don't exist
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Make you lay awake and wish
That you never felt something as good as this

Pretend I don’t exis-is-is-ist (Ooh yeah)
Pretend I don’t exis-is-is-ist
Pretend I don’t exis-is-is-ist (Ooh yeah)
Pretend I don’t exis-is-is-ist
