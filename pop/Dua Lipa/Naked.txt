Hi, nice to meet ya
Everything about ya got me painting pictures
I wanna kiss ya, dying to know how you taste
(Hey!)
You are getting closer, every little step I'm losing my composure
Ooh, to think we're sober
We gotta slow down the pace

Wooh-ooh, we got so much time
More than just tonight
But one thing's on my mind
So I'm doing
Anything to stop myself from loving you
That's what I'm tryna do
But I just wanna see you naked
Anything to stop myself from rushing it
You know I can't resist
'Cause I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked

Time, out the meter
In another minute, I'll be underneath ya
I feel the fеver, so much of you on the brain
Say you feel the samе way
I'ma keep you talking all the way to my place
Wait, tap on the breaks
Baby, it's too good to waste

Wooh-ooh, we got so much time
More than just tonight
But one thing's on my mind
So I'm doing

Anything to stop myself from loving you
That's what I'm tryna do
But I just wanna see you naked
Anything to stop myself from rushing it
You know I can't resist
'Cause I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked
Ice broken, my self control
So thin, no matter what, can't win
(I just wanna see you naked)
Innocent, my self control, so thin, wanna see you again
(I just wanna see you naked)
So I'm doing

Anything to stop myself from loving you
That's what I'm tryna do
But I just wanna see you naked
Anything to stop myself from rushing it
You know I can't resist (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause I just wanna see you naked

I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked
