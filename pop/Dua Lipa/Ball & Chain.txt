Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain (Ooh)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Ooh)
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you)
It ain't about the money, don't matter where you're from
Don't care 'bout what you believe in
Or who you wanna love
Let's get back to basics, before we turn to dust
Forget about all the illusions
Tonight it's us

Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Sweat drippin' out our body, that's how we shed our pain
The monsters waiting outside, like poison for the brain
Things get a little bit crazy, don't need to feel ashamed
There's no more time for cryin'
You can be our DJ
Play our worries away
You can be our savior
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Trapped inside the rhythm world, I feel free
Let me be your prisoner
Suffocated by the beat, lets me breathe
Keep on lightin' me up, keep on lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you, need you)
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life
Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Hang on)
I’ll be dancin', we’ll be dancing for our lives
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Hang on)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life
