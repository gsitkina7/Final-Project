Now that our love's dying out
And there’s no laughter left around
And there's a weakness in my soul
Now that I am going it alone (Hey)

Now that you're sober, feelings are over
Will you remember then
The things that I will not forget?
I know that you ain't gonna stay
But will you bring flowers to the grave?
I'm gonna bury my heart
Six feet under the ground
Today it's over, I'm letting go
I'm buried right from the start
We knew we'd tear us apart
We're burning down while the river flows

We were once us, now we're none
Yeah, we were tied, but now undone
Oh, darling, I want you to know
That I never wanted you to go (Hey)

Now that you're sober, feelings are over
Will you remember then
The things that I will not forget?
I know that you ain't gonna stay
But will you bring flowers to the grave?

I'm gonna bury my heart
Six feet under the ground
Today it's over, I'm letting go
I'm buried right from the start
We knew we'd tear us apart
We're burning down while the river flows
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm gonna bury my heart
Six feet under the ground
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Today it's over, I'm letting go
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I’m buried right from the start
We knew we'd tear us apart
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're burning down while the river flows

Six feet under the ground
