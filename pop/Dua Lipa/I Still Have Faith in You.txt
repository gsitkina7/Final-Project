I still have faith in you
I see it now
Through all these years, that faith lives on somehow
There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh-so hard to find

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way
But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

Do I have it in me?
I believе it is in there
For I know I hear a bittеrsweet song
In the memories we share

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived
And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We’re in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything
I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
Do I have it in me?

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived
And we know that we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

(I still have faith in you)
And we still have it in us
We've only just arrived
(Do I have it in me?)
We stand on a summit
Humble and grateful
To have survived
I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love
Do I have it in me?
