When I open my eyes in the morning
And it’s just getting dark where you are
Now there’s more than just space in between us
Darlin', how did we get so far?
Then you'd say, "Do you still wanna do this?"
Is it magic or is it too hard?
Love you too much to say what the truth is
So, I say yes when I should say no

As much as this hurts
I'm making it worse
No, you don't decide to wait for me
Don't want you to leave
That's selfish of me
I want you to find somebody who
Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, go on and get her
She'll love you bettеr
And I know we said forever, wе said forever, but ooh
If you just let her, she'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me

When I land and I'm back up in your arms
Can't imagine how I'd live without you
When we kiss how I live for the good times
I forget what the fight was about

As much as this hurts
I'm making it worse
No, you don't decide to wait for me
Don't want you to leave
That's selfish of me
I want you to find somebody who

Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, go on and get her
She'll love you better
And I know we said forever, we said forever, but ooh
If you just let her, she'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
And I know you keep sayin' I'm the one
Sayin' I'm the one
I don't think that this is really what you want
What you really want
Somebody who
Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, we said forever, we said forever, ooh

Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, go on and get her
She'll love you better
And I know we said forever, we said forever, but ooh
If you just let her, she'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
