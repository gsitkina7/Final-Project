I'mma ease your troubled mind, help you let it go
I'mma make your troubles mine (Yeah)
Carry all this extra weight, you gotta let it go
I'm your bittersweet escape (Yeah)

Lay by my side, lost in my eyes, deep in the night
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by
We'll go for a ride, maybe I might hold you too tight
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by
Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright
Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright

"Rest In Pеace" is mon amie, all you left mе with
The scent of perfume mixed with bleach (Yeah)
Light a match and burn the scene, all you left me with
Is petrol on my skinny jeans (Yeah)

Lay by my side, lost in my eyes, deep in the night
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by
We'll go for a ride, maybe I might hold you too tight
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by

Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright
Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
But it's alright

Can I take you out to sea?
That's where I let you be
Then I'll see you off to sleep
Can I take you out to sea?
That's where I let you be
Then I'll see you off to sleep

Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright
Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright

It's alright
It's alright
But it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
But it's alright
