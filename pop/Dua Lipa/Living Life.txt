I'm still wandering alone
Tryna find a heartbeat in a home
Wishing we were set in stone
Will you wait here when I go?
What's ahead? No one knows

When it starts to rain (Starts to rain)
When the seasons change (Seasons change)
When you fade away (Fade away)
My baby (Ooh)
Will I be the same? (Be the same)
Will I speak your name? (Speak your name)
Guess it's hard to say (Hard to say)
My baby, baby
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living lifе, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, lifе, life (Whoa)

Tryna find a heartbeat in a home
Wishing we were set in stone
Will you wait here when I go?
What’s ahead? No one knows

When it starts to rain (Starts to rain)
When the seasons change (Seasons change)
When you fade away (Fade away)
My baby (Ooh)
Will I be the same? (Be the same)
Will I speak your name? (Speak your name)

Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
