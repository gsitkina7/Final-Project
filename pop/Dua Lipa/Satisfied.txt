(Go)
(Go)

One hand on my shoulder
Gets a little bit closer
Mans all makes a move, yeah (Go)
Skip through all the small talk
You wanna see me with the lights off
Says "Let's go to your room"
Yeah (Go)
I know that you're impatient
Your imagination's wanderin' and runnin' wild
I can hear that, your heart is racing
I'm sorry to say I'm goin' home alone tonight, yeah (Go)

Don't need nobody to put their hands on my body
'Cause I can be my somebody
You know I keep me satisfied
Hear me breathing
I, I don't want it, I need it
And now that I'm getting heated
You know I keep me satisfied

I don't wanna wait, I'm ready to go
I'll get me out of these clothes
You know I keep me satisfied
I don't wanna wait, I'm ready to go
I'll get me out of these clothes
You know I keep me satisfied

I'm ready to go home
Just me with the lights low
I don't need a lover (Go)
I tell you I'm leavin', but you don't believe it
You come on a little stronger
I know that you're impatient
Your imagination's wanderin' and runnin' wild
I can hear that, your heart is racing
I'm sorry to say I'm goin' home alone tonight, yeah (Go)

Don't need nobody to put their hands on my body
'Cause I can be my somebody
You know I keep me satisfied
Hear me breathing
I, I don't want it, I need it
And now that I'm getting heated
You know I keep me satisfied

I don't wanna wait, I'm ready to go
I'll get me out of these clothes
You know I keep me satisfied
I don't wanna wait, I'm ready to go
I'll get me out of these clothes
You know I keep me satisfied

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hey, hey, yeah
Don't need nobody to put their hands on my body
'Cause I can be my somebody
You know I keep me satisfied
Hear me breathing
I, I don't want it, I need it
And now that I'm getting heated
You know I keep me satisfied

I don't wanna wait, I'm ready to go
I'll get me out of these clothes
You know I keep me satisfied
I don't wanna wait, I'm ready to go
I'll get me out of these clothes
You know I keep me satisfied

Don't need nobody to put their hands on my body (Oh, oh, yeah)
'Cause I can be my somebody
You know I keep me satisfied
Hear me breathing
I don't want it, I need it
And now that I'm getting heated
You know I keep me satisfied

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Keep me satisfied (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Keep me satisfied
