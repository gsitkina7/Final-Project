Slipped away like grains of sand
Couldn't hold you long enough in my hands
Can't remember how it went from good to bad
Now I just reminisce, I just reminisce on everything we had

The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes
That feels like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me

I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen

I never meant for it to end this way (End this way)
I wish that I could say this face to face (Face to face)
Holding on for hope your mind would change (Mind would change)
'Cause I want you back (Want you back)
I need you back to take this pain away (Take this pain away)

The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes
That feels like a distant memory now

If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen

My only request, I wish you the best
But I can't get no sleep, I can't get no rest
My head is a mess, between "No" and "Yes"
Right now you're heavy on my mind
I don't wanna guess what you're thinking tonight
I want the facts, I don't want no more lies
I just want a chance to make it right
I just want a chance to make it right

If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me

I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
