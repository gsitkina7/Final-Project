I don't know, don't know how it seems but
I ain't tryna take your freedom
I just wanna know where your heart's at
'Cause it's been so long since you text back
Got me wondering what happened
I see them pictures of you laughing
I don't wanna run out of time to
Tell you how I feel about you

No, I don't wanna overthink
But I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm not expecting anything
I'm just asking you to
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

You let me, let me, let mе love you
But only, only when you want to
It's good that we'rе both staying busy
I just wanna know if you miss me
Take a second and imagine
See it all before it happens
If you feel the vibe, make it times two
You don't have to ask, you know I do, ooh

No, I don't wanna overthink
But I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm not expecting anything
I'm just asking you to
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

I've been waiting for you to give me something
All my patience, don't let it be for nothing
I've been (I've been) waiting (Waiting)
For you to give me something
I'm just asking you to

Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
