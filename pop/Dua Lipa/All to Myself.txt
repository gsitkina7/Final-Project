Feels like we're all alone but we're here in a crowded room
Your eyes all on me and my eyes are looking right at you
Feels like I've known you for a lifetime but it's just day two
So into you (So into you)
Something about you in the way that you just say my name
It makes me wanna throw my hands up 'cause you know I'm game
Wanna unlock the movies I got playin' in my brain (In my brain)
Of you and me (Of you and me)

Honestly for you there's no one but me
And honestly I want you
I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

Up in the canyon with the flowers, they were all in bloom
Your hand on the lower part of my back, so close to you
You know the feeling when you're falling?
Well, I fell for you (I fell for you)
You know it's true (You know it's true)

Honestly for you there's no one but me
And honestly I want you

I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
Baby I say goodbye to all the rest
You're the one that gets me best
Only, only one, only, only one
Baby just say goodbye to all the rest
'Cause I'm the one that gets you best
Only, only one, only, only one

Honestly for you there's no one but me
And honestly I want you

I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

Baby I say goodbye to all the rest (Ooh-ooh)
You're the one that gets me best (Ooh-ooh)
Only, only one (Ooh-ooh), only, only one (Ooh-ooh)
Baby I say goodbye to all the rest (Ooh-ooh)
You're the one that gets me best (Ooh-ooh)
Only, only one (Ooh-ooh), only, only one (Ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
