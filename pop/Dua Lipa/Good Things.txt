Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now (Oh)
Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now

Heavy like the bass-line
Way past “Good Girl” bed time
Had too much, drunk as fuck
Swaying to those red lights
On my worst behavior
Making out with strangers
Dusty buzz, feel the rush
Speeding through my head
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me

Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight (Oh)
Good things, good things
Happen before sunrise, sunrise
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now (Oh)

Dirty like the dance-floor
Psychedelic candy store
In a transe, dizzy stance
I got what you’re looking for
Naughty indication, give into temptation
Late at night, what a high
When we conversate
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me

Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight (Oh)
Good things, good things
Happen before sunrise, sunrise
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now (Oh)


Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight (Oh)
Good things, good things
Happen before sunrise, sunrise
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now (Oh)
