Have you ever seen
Some people lose everything
First to go is their mind
Responsibility
To me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time
I want to join a band
And play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation Give me the melody
That's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap (Caught up!)
No turnin' back (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We're lost in music

We're lost in music
