You're the saint to my sin
All my lies are wearin' thin
Let me go, don't let me in
Love me up, I come undone
See the darkness I've become
Holding me close, and not enough

I can't breathe, let me be
What I need is to be free
I wanna light a fire
I know how to chase what I desire
I wanna scream a little higher
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
'Til I overflow, oh, oh

Now my words cause you pain
An even game of give and take
Go ahead, save yourself from the shame
My biggest fear is here to stay
My regret is what remains
Losing you was my mistake

I can't breathe, let me be
What I need is to be free

I wanna light a fire
I know how to chase what I desire
I wanna scream a little higher
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
We drift apart like lovers do
And now I'm drownin' without you
(Never wanna see, never wanna see
Never wanna see, never wanna)
We drift apart like lovers do
And now I'm drownin' without you
(Never wanna see, never wanna see
Never wanna see, never wanna)

I wanna light a fire
I know how to chase what I desire
I wanna scream a little higher
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
