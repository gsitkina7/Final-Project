Maybe I'm miseducated
Lauryn Hill mistaken
Looking up at the sun, so my mind awakens
I'm running wild, tryna find the light
Tell me, baby, are you with me or just for the night?
I'm hurting, aching
Slowly fading, breaking
The haze is filling my mind, like it's medicating
Playing with fire, 'til our hands are tied
Falling for you's the definition of suicide
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me

“Never get high off your own supply”
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, high-igh-igh-yeah)

My friends say I have a hundred issues
Guess I'm stubborn with you
I'll take it as it comes, as long as I'm coming with you
I'm ill-behaved, I can't be saved
All the advice I was given, I just threw away

Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me
“Never get high off your own supply”
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply

Mmm (I can’t feel my face, I can’t feel my face)
I can’t feel my face from my mistakes
And all the things I’ve tried to hide
Can’t feel my face, just took one taste
And then we wasted our supply
I can’t feel my face, can’t feel my face
And all the things I, I, I, I can’t feel my face
I can’t feel my face

Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me
“Never get high off your own supply”
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Own supply, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Never get high off your own supply
