Hanging on minutes
It's you and me versus the sun
Don’t wanna finish
It feels good, it's too good
This is religious, my body's speaking in tongues
I won't forget this, it feels good, it's too good

We can't stop time (Time), but we got all night long
Baby, you're always mine (Mine)
Distance don't mean you're gone (Gone)
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep

We got emotions all over, I don't know where
I reach for the open, you're not here, not here
Replay all the moments
Breathe you like you're air
Used to let my focus so clear, so clear

We can't stop time (Time), but we got all night long
Baby, you’re always mine
Distance don’t mean you’re gone (Gone)
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep

Don't think about the time
Don't think about goodbye
Right here, right now
There's nothing stopping us from this love
Don't think about the time
Don't think about goodbye
Right here, right now
There's nothing stopping us from this love
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
