Hmm, hmm

I'm numb and I'm broken, my wounds are so close
And I'm trying to tie a knot where the bar is still open tonight, tonight
Put the cup to my lessons, I speak without thinking
And it'll all disappear if I just keep on drinking tonight, tonight

Why am I dealing with our pain?
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change?
No, no
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else

Open my eyes and the sky is in mourning
A part of me died, but a new day is turning in light, in light
Confusion and heartache, I'm back where I started
I'm back at thе bar once so dearly departеd last night, yeah

Why am I dealing with our pain?
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change?
No, no

So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else
