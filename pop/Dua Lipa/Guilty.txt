Guilty, guilty, guilty

Took myself out for dancing, a little romancing
I’m learning to be alone
Left that sadness behind me, won’t let it define me
I’m on my own, no

I don’t have to tell you where I’m going
Who I’m going with or when I’ll be back home
Back home
Feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)

We could blame it on timing, if that justifies it
But we have to let go
This new rhythm I’m finding
Is helping me find me
I hope you do too

You don’t have to tell me where you’re going
Who you’re going with or when you’ll be back home
Back home

Oh, I’m feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)
Feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
Feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)
