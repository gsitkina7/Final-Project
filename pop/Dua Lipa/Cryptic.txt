I got nothing left to say
And you got nothing left to play
You got nothing left to place
Sick and tired of your games
Don't believe in what you say

Is it written in your eyes?
You can try, you can try
But you can't disguise
And I don't need it anymore
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore

You keep your cards to your chest
You got lies in your bed, you got lies in your bed
You been sleeping on the truth
Never tell it, do you?

Is it written in your eyes?
You can try, you can try
But you can't disguise
And I don't need it anymore

Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore
Why you have to be so cruel?
Why don't you just play it straight?
Tryna play me for a fool
Why you gotta play that way?
Why you havе to be so cruel?
Why don't you just play it straight?
Tryna play me for a fool
Why you gotta play that way?

Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta bе cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta play that way?
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore
