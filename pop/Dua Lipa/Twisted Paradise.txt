I can't believe what I just said
This is so not like me, playing the words up in my head
And there's no denying
I had a heart and you stole it
So I called you up tonight, and said, "Do whatever you like"
Yeah

I want what I want when I want it
Come and do me right until the morning
You taste like danger to me (You taste like danger to me)
Baby, you're forbidden and delicious
And you got my heartbeat beating triplets
I'm ready for anything
You're my twisted paradise, take me to thе dark tonight
Life is so mundane herе without ya, without ya
You're my twisted paradise, pride's gonna be my sacrifice
Let me wrap my body around ya, around ya
It's not like me at all to close my eyes and freefall
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise-ise

I wanna sink in you like quicksand, you're the air I'm breathing
Lose every layer in your hands, words can be deceiving
Why's it feel so good to be bad?
So I'll call you up tonight, and I'll do whatever you like, baby

I want what I want when I want it
Come and do me right until the morning
I'm ready for anything

You're my twisted paradise, take me to the dark tonight
Life is so mundane here without ya, without ya
You're my twisted paradise, pride's gonna be my sacrifice
Let me wrap my body around ya, around ya
It's not like me at all to close my eyes and freefall
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise-ise
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise
I can't believe what I just said (Take me to the dark tonight)
Replaying words up in my head (You're my twisted paradise)
(Ow!)

You're my twisted paradise, take me to the dark tonight
Life is so mundane here without ya, without ya
You're my twisted paradise, pride's gonna be my sacrifice
Let me wrap my body around ya, around ya
It's not like me at all to close my eyes and freefall
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise-ise
