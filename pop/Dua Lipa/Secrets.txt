Moving too fast, they say it won’t last
But I just wanna
Yeah, I just wanna see for myself
The summer days melt, no kiss and no tell
‘Cause I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna
Ooh

I been waiting for you, been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know whеn the time is right
Ooh
For now lets keep it sеcret

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)

Lemme savor all your flavors
And I don’t wanna, yeah
I don’t wanna share with no one
Feel them watching, but we ain’t talking
Boy, I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna
Ooh

I been waiting for you, been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know when the time is right
Ooh
For now lets keep it secret

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)

One day we could tell ‘em all
We could tell ‘em how
We could tell ‘em when
We could tell ‘em what
But for now let’s keep it secret
One day we could reminisce
When nobody knew about the way we kiss
And the way we touch
But for now let’s keep it secret
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know when the time is right
Ooh
For now lets keep it secret

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
