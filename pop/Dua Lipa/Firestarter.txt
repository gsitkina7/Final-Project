I just left my man at home
Me and my girls are about to go
Get our freaky, sexy on
On, on
You know I secured the bag
The good intentions never last
I’m about to spend my cash
Ah, ah

So let's just move to the beat now
Nothing you do could change my mood
Couple drinks down, my energy is out the roof
I like it, just trust and light the fuse
Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire-starter, gotta set the alarm off
Make ya hot and I got you in a cold-sweat
Got you drippin' wet, make ya (Hah, hah)
I’m a fire-starter, gotta set the alarm off
Makе ya hot and I got you in a cold-sweat
Got you drippin' wet, make ya (Hah, hah)

I likе the way I make 'em dance
Future Nostalgia on blast
Mystikal, so shake that ass, ah-ah
