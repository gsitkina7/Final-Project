(With you, with you, ah, ah)
(With you, with you, ah, ah)

Who are you at the back of the room?
Why're you hiding in the shadows
Are you ever gonna make a move?
Are you ever gonna make a move?
I'm in the lights, but you're dancing in the dark
Tell me what I gotta do to get you over here
And play your part
Won't you come over here and play your part?
Yeah
Boy, I hate the wait
And by now I think you know
It'll soon be late, tell me why
Don't you follow me?
Your sweetest fantasy
Give in to what you need, what you need
What you need
Follow the voice inside
I could be yours tonight
Step out into the wild, to the wild, to the wild

Follow me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight

Don't be surprised when I let you in the game
â€˜Cause I'm married to the moment, baby
Tell me if you wanna play
Tell me if you wanna play
You know you want it
When I'm calling out your name
Why're you trying to hide the truth
When I see the smile on your face
Oh, I see the smile on your face
Boy, I hate the wait
And by now I think you know
It'll soon be late, tell me why
Don't you follow me?
Your sweetest fantasy
Give in to what you need, what you need
What you need
Follow the voice inside
I could be yours tonight
Step out into the wild, to the wild, to the wild

Follow me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight

(With you, with you)
(Ah, ah)
(With you)
Tell me why don't you follow me?
Your sweetest fantasy
Give in to what you need, what you need
What you need
Follow the voice inside
I could be yours tonight
Step out into the wild, to the wild, to the wild

Follow me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Follow me tonight
