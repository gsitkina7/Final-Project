Wait a minute, uh

You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
(You-ooh)

Act of God, don’t know how it started
Now I'm boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)

Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine (Need it to be)
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused (Confused)
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you
(You-ooh)

Act of God, don’t know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

I’m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me

Act of God, don’t know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)
