I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore

And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

Make it hard to talk and see
I'm just where I wanna be
Holding you too close to me
You never leave my glass empty
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted
Broken people in the streets
Yet they’re beautiful to see
Everything is incomplete
Yeah, it feels a lot like me
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted

And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore
And I like that, kinda like that
Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
