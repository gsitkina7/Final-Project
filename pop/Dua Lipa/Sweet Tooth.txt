D-d-d-do it, do it well
Since you got a piece
I wonder, "Who'd you tell?"
V-v-v-vicious (Vicious)
The way I play
If you play your cards right
You'll get some today, ay (Ow!)

You got me weak (Weak)
All through my veins, boy
I can barely sleep (Sleep)
Adrenaline tornado
On until night-time
Any time's the right time
Gimme what I need (Need)
Slice into my cake, boy
You're the sweetest crush (Uh-huh)
Sherbert on my tongue (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
It's unpredictable
Like a sugar rush (Uh-huh)
Lick the buttercup (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
You get the visual

Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Piеce of candy joy
You know, you know, you know
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Got the sweetest tooth
Got mе hooked on you

Do it, do it well
Since you got a piece
I wonder, "Who'd you tell?"
V-v-v-vicious (Vicious)
The way I play
If you play your cards right
You'll get some today, ay (Ow!)
You got the love, the love that I need
Stuck in my mind and stuck in my teeth
You feel so good like cotton candy
Let me just be your favorite, repeat
You got the love, the love that I want
Just gettin' started, no I'm not done
Give me dessert from your restaurant
Soft on my skin like Yves St. Laurent

You're the sweetest crush (Uh-huh)
Sherbert on my tongue (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
It's unpredictable
Like a sugar rush (Uh-huh)
Lick the buttercup (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
You get the visual

Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Piece of candy joy
You know, you know, you know
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Got the sweetest tooth
Got me hooked on you
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Piece of candy joy
You know, you know, you know
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Got the sweetest tooth
Got me hooked on you
You're the sweetest crush (Uh-huh)
Sugar on my tongue (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
It's unpredictable
Like a sugar rush (Uh-huh)
Lick the buttercup (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
You get the visual
