(Way, way, way, way)

Drifting away, should I leave and let us break?
Torn, torn apart, left a hole in my heart

I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn't have it any other
Way, way, way
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire

Stone, stone cold
Only you can warm my soul
Bones turn to dust
Locked away, left untouched

I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw

Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn’t have it any other
(Way, way, way)
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire
Roses in a fire
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw

Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn’t have it any other
(Way, way, way)
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire
