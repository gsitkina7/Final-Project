I'll be there when you call
To pick you up off the ground
When the weight of the world's too heavy on you
Dry your tears if you cry
Be the light to your fire
Pull you out of the dark if that's what you're going through

We both know love is fucking crazy
But we're not letting go without a fight
Right?
Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be perfect to make it work
Keep it real so we don't have to fake it
Instead of giving you up on I give my all
Hold on, I know we can make it
Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be so complicated

Ain't nobody alive
Could take you out of my mind
You came into my life right when I needed you
We don't like playing games
We just cut to the chase
'Cause we both get each other high

We both know love is fucking crazy
But we're not letting go without a fight
Right?

Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be perfect to make it work
Keep it real so we don't have to fake it
Instead of giving you up on I give my all
Hold on, I know we can make it
Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be so complicated
I, I
I lose my mind
When I'm by your side
I lose my mind

Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be perfect to make it work
Keep it real so we don't have to fake it
Instead of giving you up on I give my all
Hold on, I know we can make it
Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be perfect to make it work
Keep it real so we don't have to fake it
Instead of giving you up on I give my all
Hold on, I know we can make it
Doesn't have to be so complicated
Doesn't have to be so complicated
