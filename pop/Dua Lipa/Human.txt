As the light follows through the day
And the dark follows through the night
What does it mean, what does it mean? Yeah
You say the gold never fades away
I’d trade the gold for you any day
What does it mean, what does it mean? Yeah

I don’t need the pretty lights
No recognition for tonight
I, I just wanna live my life, oh
Calling out my fuckin’ name
I’m a human, yes I say
I’m the same way as I came, oh
I want you to love me, I want you to love me
If I had no-nothing no more
Would you say that you love me
Say that you love me?
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more

Oh, I, I wanna go in deep
Show you what’s underneath
What does it mean, what does it mean? Yeah
So I am giving you all of me
What you get now is what you see
That’s what I mean, that’s what I mean, yeah

I don’t need the pretty lights
No recognition for tonight
I, I just wanna live my life, oh
Calling out my fuckin’ name
I’m a human, yes I say
I’m the same way as I came, oh
I want you to love me, I want you to love me
If I had no-nothing no more
Would you say that you love me
Say that you love me?
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more

Tell me, tell me, tell me what you see
Tell me is it you or is it me?
If I got you, you know that I don’t need
Nothing, nothing, nothing no more
Tell me, tell me, tell me what you see
Tell me is it you or is it me?
If I got you, you know that I don’t need
Nothing, nothing, nothing no more

I want you to love me, I want you to love me
If I had no-nothing no more
Would you say that you love me
Say that you love me?
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more (Oh)
If I had no-nothing no more
