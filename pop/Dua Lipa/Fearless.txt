Yo, the club is mine the second I walk in
Try not to stare, can't believe it's him
Raise up your hands, can't hold it back
I can't get enough of me, hooked like that
If you think you're good enough, trust you ain't
My head ain't turned by moves that fake
Center of the club, don't make me wait
I'm here for the night, I'ma run this place

Wake up, this party's popping
Ain't no sleepin' when the bass is knocking
I didn't come here to watch the action
You better hold on, 'cause I ain't actin'
Pop off the cork and pump the bottle
Jump up on thе tables, and go full throttle
Throw up your arms and whip your head back
I wanna hеar everybody go crazy
Nobody in the club can resist this
Gonna be impossible to miss it
We ain't got tomorrow for forgiveness
It's a good thing that we're fearless

Yo, the night's on the edge now
One more move
Got another round of drinks
So lean, so smooth
The girls try to hookup, hey, don't fight
I ain't goin' home, got a big appetite

Wake up, this party's popping
Ain't no sleepin' when the bass is knocking
I didn't come here to watch the action
You better hold on, 'cause I ain't actin'
Pop off the cork and pump the bottle
Jump up on the tables, and go full throttle
Throw up your arms and whip your head back
I wanna hear everybody go crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)

Nobody in the club can resist this
Gonna be impossible to miss it
We ain't got tomorrow for forgiveness
It's a good thing that we're fearless
Nobody in the club can resist this
Gonna be impossible to miss it
We ain't got tomorrow for forgiveness
It's a good thing that we're fearless
