I've been a stranger in the most familiar place
(Mmm, mmm)
Thought it was safer when I stood in the shade
(Mmm, mmm)
Okay, well, here goes nothing
Might be the start of something
I’m steady, pickin' up the pace
Nothin' to lose, but I got the whole world to gain
(Mmm, mmm)
This is the part where the bridge burns
This is the part where we turn and never look back
This is the point of no return, no return

Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain’t sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us undеr the lights
Eh, eh, eh, еh, eh, eh
Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain't sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us under the lights
Under the lights

We're renegades into stage and we won't take a bow
(Mmm, mmm)
Flooding the gates, what they say
And we're drowning it out
(Mmm, mmm)
You're slowly runnin’ out of breath
My heart is racin’ out my chest
Steady, pickin' up the pace
Look me in the eyes, tell me, who’s gonna stop us now?
(Mmm, mmm)
This is the part where the bridge burns
This is the part where we turn and never look back
This is the point of no return, no return

Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain't sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us under the lights
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain't sleeping tonight
You know you’ll find us under the lights
Under the lights

Take a chance, don't be afraid to risk it all
Hold my hand, we'll let ‘em know where we belong

Here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain't sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us under the lights
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain't sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us under the lights
Under the lights
