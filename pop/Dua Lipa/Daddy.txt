Cigarettes and loneliness
I lost my way, haven't found it yet
An hour late, still undressed
I feel used, I'm confused, my life's such a mess

Who do I turn to when I'm in need?
Who is the person that's there for me?

Oh, daddy
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh-oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?
My drink is warm, but I'm penniless
It doesn't show in the way I'm dressed
I'm nearing drunk and I lost my phone
Had enough of this club and I can't go home

Who do I turn to when I'm in need?
Who is the person that's there for me?

Oh, daddy
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh-oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?

My daddy said, my daddy said, my daddy said
My daddy said, my daddy said, my daddy said
My daddy said, my daddy said, my daddy said
My daddy said, my daddy said
Oh, daddy
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh-oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?
Oh, daddy (I know, I know, I know, I know)
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy (I know, I know, I know, I know)
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?
