(Terms and conditions, hmm)
So look

There's a waste of time
Smoke inhale it all
Take the pain off my mind
I'm sorry bout the way that I've acted lately
I know you just care and you just wanna save me
Trying to enhance the performance of my mind
Taking advice from buried bombs
And this time I may be (I may be)
Out of line, I may be (I may be)
Out of time, oh my
All the stars, I count fall from the sky (From the sky)
'Cause you, you've been my Angel in disguise (In disguise)
But I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
Thеse are my (Thesе are my)

Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
These are my, these are my
Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
Terms and conditions
Th-these are my, these are my
Terms and conditions

I've just been exploring, and honesty is boring
If you're looking for a summary of my life
I tried to do something you thought was incapable
Tried to be someone you think is unchangeable
But who I am has always been the person I am inside
That person is too inescapable
And I know that you had got some things to say
But maybe those things are debatable
(Yeah, that's debatable)
So fade the lights to black
And go in that spooky black
Sippin' with class
And one of these days, maybe I'll call you back
All the stars, I count fall from the sky (From the sky, oh)
'Cause you, you've been my Angel in disguise (In disguise)
But I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
These are my (These are my)

Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
These are my, these are my
Terms and conditions (These are my)
Ter-terms and conditions (These are my)
Terms and conditions (These are my)
Th-these are my, these are my (My)
Terms and conditions
(Terms and conditions, eh, terms and conditions)

All the stars, I count fall from the sky
'Cause you, you've been my Angel in disguise
But I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
These are my
(Terms and conditions)
