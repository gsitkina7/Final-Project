Hey, is this thing on?
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

Call me a savage
When I'm shoutin' down that phone
You say I'm tragic
'Cause I'm picking fights alone
Over-dramatic
I swear this used to turn you on
I scream and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know
Call me romantic
Yeah, I do it all for love
You say it's plastic
'Cause you seen it all before
I know it's classic
But with the highs they come the lows
I scream and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know that

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know I'm a lot but you got me now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know that it's love when you stick around
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah

How do you stand it
When I drive you up the wall?
I know it's manic
But you always break my fall
After the madness
We forget about it all
I scrеam and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know that
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know I'm a lot but you got me now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know that it's love whеn you stick around
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah

Tell me when you, when you had enough
You ain't got time, time to listen up
I get you're mad, let me make it up
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know I'm a lot but you got me now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know that it's love when you stick around
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah

Tell me when you, when you had enough
You ain't got time, time to listen up
I get you're mad, let me make it up
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh
