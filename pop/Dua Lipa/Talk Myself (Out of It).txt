I woke up in your bed
I can’t believe I did it again
Am I still drunk? My head’s a mess
I took you back, this never ends

Last time was the last time
Promise that I’d stay clear
And said “If last time was the last time
How did I end up here?" Yeah
Oh, and I know that I should say goodbye
Yeah, oh, and God knows I try, I try, and I try to
Talk myself out of it (I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it (I tried to)
Talk myself out of it (But I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it

Your body speaks, and mine replies
We conversate, our tongues are tied
And yeah I know, we’ll nevеr last
But I can’t leave when you touch likе that

Last time was the last time
Promise that I’d stay clear
And said “If last time was the last time
How did I end up here?" Yeah
Oh, and I know that I should say goodbye
Yeah, oh, and God knows I try, I try, and I try to

Talk myself out of it (I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it (I tried to)
Talk myself out of it (But I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it
(I woke up in your bed
I can’t believe I did it again, I did it again
I woke up in your bed
I can’t believe I did it again, I did it again)

Talk myself out of it (I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it (I tried to)
Talk myself out of it (But I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it
Talk myself out of it (I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it (I tried to)
Talk myself out of it (But I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it

(Talk myself out of it)
(Talk myself out of it, I tried to)
(Talk myself out of it, but I just can’t)
(Talk myself out of it)
