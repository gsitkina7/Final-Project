(You) Keep pushing, but gotta keep it moving, make a (Move)
You're telling yourself, stop telling yourself
Only you know how to do what it do (Ooh)

Finger on the trigger, aim, and pull it
Bite the bullet
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started
You've come so far, don't you cry about it, cry about it
So before your time's done, bite the bullet, don't run, run
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started

Here we go now, darlin', fire the gun
Never slow down, bite the bullet and run
Here we go now, darlin', fire the gun
Never slow down, bite the bullet and run

(I) Think it's time, it's time to pull up on 'em with it

You've come so far, don't you cry about it, cry about it
So before your time's done, bite the bullet, don't run, run
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started
Here we go now, darlin', fire the gun
Never slow down, bite the bullet and run
Here we go now, darlin', fire the gun
Never slow down, bite the bullet and run

If you're waiting on tomorrow, no, not waiting on tomorrow
You can count it when it's borrowed
Leave it up for today, here's to makin' that change
Baby, you got one shot, bite the bullet, bite the bullet

Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started (Started)
You've come so far, don't you cry about it, cry about it
