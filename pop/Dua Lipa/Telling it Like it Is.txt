Baby you should leave this girl alone
But you won't, won’t, won't
But you don't, don’t, don't
Now delete my number from your phone
But you won't-won't-won't
You gotta go, go, go
Oh my, my, my
Gonna spell it right out

I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it’s me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don’t feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don’t need you to say those words over
I'm just telling it like it is
Boy, man up
You're not some animal
No no no, no no no
Rather die a thousand times tonight
Than take you home, than take you home
These walls I build, they're never coming down

I don’t know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words over
I'm just telling it like it is

I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is
I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is, I tell it like it is
Cause I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words over
I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words over
I'm just telling it like it is
