I do what I like, babes
Do ya know what I mean?

You only seen the cover, you ain't open the book
Know that you would like him if you just take a look
There's nothing you can do, 'cause I'm already hooked
I got this, I got this
(You ain't) You ain't gotta worry 'cause he love me for me
I know he got my back, he's the boy of my dreams
I'm better when I'm with him and I wish you could see
I got this, I got this
You should feel good, he treats me right
Thought that you'd have an open mind
This love is more than just a night, a night
And you can't tell me nothing

I do, I do, I do what I like
Daddy, I promise
I'm willing to listen, but the choice is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
I gotta be honest, I made a decision
And the boy is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
(I do, I do, I do)
I do, I do, I do what I like
(What I like, I like, I like)

Never really cared what nobody would say
Call him what you want but Iâ€™m callin' him "Babe"
I'ma have it my way at the end of the day
I got this, I got this
(You're the) You're the one who told me I should think for myself
And I'm thinking that I'm good with the cards I've been dealt
So trust me, if I need ya, I will call for your help
I got this, I got this
You should feel good, he treats me right
Thought that you'd have an open mind
This love is more than just a night, a night
And you can't tell me nothing

I do, I do, I do what I like
Daddy, I promise
I'm willing to listen, but the choice is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
I gotta be honest, I made a decision
And the boy is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
(I do, I do, I do)
I do, I do, I do what I like
(What I like, I like, I like)

No, you can't tell me anything
Do what I wanna do, ooh, ooh, ooh
No, you can't tell me anything
Do what I wanna do, ooh, ooh, ooh

I do, I do, I do what I like
Daddy, I promise
I'm willing to listen, but the choice is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
I gotta be honest, I made a decision
And the boy is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
Daddy, I promise
I'm willing to listen, but the choice is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
I gotta be honest, I made a decision
And the boy is mine
I made a decision and the boy is mine
