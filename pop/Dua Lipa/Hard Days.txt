I told myself "I'd never let it hurt me”
Been wasting tears on things that don’t deserve me
Blessed with the curse to feel as deeply as I do
(As I do, as I do, as I do)
I’m compromised and losin’ all my senses
Give me the rush, but easy on the tension
Oh, here it comes, that kind of blue I'm so used to
(So used to, so used to, so used to)

It’s one of those nights
I’m up and can’t get out my mind
So stuck but in the morning
I look in the mirror and tell myself
“Some days are gonna be, gonna be hardеr
Than the rest of them, baby
Than thе rest of them, but it’s alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright"
(Alright, alright)

I know the taste of when it starts to creep in
It's bittersweet to make it out the deep end
So hard to see it's brighter on the other side
(Side, side, side)

It's one of those nights
I'm up and can't get out my mind
So stuck but in the morning
I look in the mirror and tell myself

"Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Than the rest of them, but it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright”
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it’s alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright (It's alright)
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright (Alright)
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright (It's alright)

Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Than the rest of them, but it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright

Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it’s alright (It’s alright)
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, ‘cause it’s alright
(It's alright, it’s alright, it's alright, it’s alright, it’s alright)
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, ‘cause it’s alright
(Days are gonna be, gonna be harder)
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
(Days are gonna be, gonna be harder)
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
