Troubled nights, a troubled guy
With nothing but entitlement behind his eyes
I wish I saw right through the lies
In that disguise, so criminal
Words can cut deep like a knife
And I know that you did it all, all out of spite
You tried to pull me down
When I was ridin’ high, hypocritical

I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way

He who comes, he who goes
There’s nothing like a boy with a, a bruisin' soul
Who runs their mouth as if he knows
So critical, so critical

I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door

We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together
Was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
Time's the only reason we decided to stay
We tried to let it go but got stuck in our ways
We're pullin’ on the chain
We were bound to break
You and me together are better this way
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
You and me together are better this way

You made me better
And knowing what I really want
Knowing who I really am
I'll never settle for nothing less than I deserve
Thank you for the lesson learned

We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together
Was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
Time's the only reason we decided to stay
We tried to let it go but got stuck in our ways
We're pullin’ on the chain
We were bound to break
You and me together are better this way
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
You and me together are better this way
