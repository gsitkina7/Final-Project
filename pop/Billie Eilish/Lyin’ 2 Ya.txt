(Ooh, Bobby raps and makes beats)
I haven't slept alone in a minute
Like to push my own limits
Is it something that I've grown into? Yeah
(CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY)
Think we too alone
You think I'm lyin' to you
Yup, I've been lyin' to you

Yup, gettin' kinda hard to breathe
With these hands all over me
Somethin' you don't wanna see
So I think I'm gonna keep on lyin' to ya (What?)
Yup, I'm lyin' to you
I'ma just keep fuckin' lyin' to you (Haha, yeah)
I try to protect her
You know I respect her
I'm not interested to leave my Sara Bellum
I can sense you jealous
I got that impression
I am not invested
You askin' them questions
You Inspector Gadget
I change my perspective
You got inconvenient
I change my direction
I feel like Mulan
I've seen my reflection
I'm tryin' to move on
I hear your objection
I see you addicted
You got an obsession
You misunderstood me
Common misconception
You overcommitted
You need to relax, man
Don't care 'bout your feelings
But I'm feeling sneaky
Yeah
Yup, gettin' kinda hard to breathe
With these hands all over me
Somethin' you don't wanna see
So I think I'm gonna keep on lyin' to ya (Woo)
Yup, I'm lyin' to you
I'ma just keep fuckin' lyin' to you (Haha)
Aye, skrt

No, I don't trust her (Woo)
She just want my charger (Skrt, skrt)
Turnt up on my Swajjur (Skrt)
Eat dick, stop the chatter (Mmm)
She's such a liar (Liar)
But the pussy fire (Hot, hot)
I got Swajjur, in my Swajjur bag
Your bitch gobble-gobble like Pac-Man
Do what I want, you do what you can (Huh)
Life sucks, better steal what you can (Brr, skrt)
Not my charger, you better watch your hands (Bitch)
Lied to the bitch 'bout fuckin' her friend (Huh)
Welp, I might as well fuck again (Haha)
Damn, she caught me lying again
