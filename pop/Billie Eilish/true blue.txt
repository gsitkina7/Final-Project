Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sleepwalk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave
I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Made mistakes, made our marks
Now we've gone dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything

I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue
True blue

I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
