Seeing the dress, seeing your face
Darken your inner self, we made our lives last longer
Hey, this is the best d**n thing in town
Money MIA, can't buy yourself new rings like the other girls
No prom, nothing for me
I always used to get so jealous of the girls at school
Now I don't have to

Look at me now mama
I'm doing everything you wanted me too
I've got everything I wanted
Now I can go back
Let's play some hide and seek
I'll count to three
You can maybe make it out alive
Hurtful words are said
So ask them to play somе hide and seek

Practicing the piano might be confusing
Got my chеck for work
Don't have to brag, I have more than you
Used to have a lover but you took him from me

Look at me now mama
I'm doing everything you wanted me too
I've got everything I wanted
Now I can go back

Let's play some hide and seek
I'll count to three
You can maybe make it out alive
Hurtful words are said
So ask them to play some hide and seek
Meet Cinderella, she'll do acapella
She even has a new friend named Bella
Who has another friend named Ella
They can't get enough of each other
I will wait forever until they disappear evermore
Wait for the sun to come down
Wait for the dark to rise

Missing out on everything
Missing out on yourself
Devils will rise and they will get payback
