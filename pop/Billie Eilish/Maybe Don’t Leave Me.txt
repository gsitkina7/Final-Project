So you wanna give up on us?
Wager all we had on lust
Sorry that I'm not enough for you
Settle for a careless love
Tarnish everything you touch
Sorry that I'm not enough for you, you

Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way
You always make it sound so easy
Just stop the singing, start the healing
Like ya shouldn't be defeated by him leaving for no reason, eh

Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way

Don't you treat me like a fool
Don't you treat me like a foolish child
Soon as I get over you
You're telling me "Come over, stay a while"
A while, a while, a while, a while, a while, a while

Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay (mmm)
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way
