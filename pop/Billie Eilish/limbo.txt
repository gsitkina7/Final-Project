I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay?
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away

To make me feel better, make it alright
To give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days
I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all, no more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away

Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

If you love me, let me go
If you love me, leave limbo

Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Can't give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, just push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days
