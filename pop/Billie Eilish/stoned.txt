Mmm
Mmm

Lay on me the weight of the world
Smiling like you're given a gift
Don't you wanna dance with your little girl?
In the shadows, I can see those things you hid
From me
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned
Mmm
Mmm

Twist my words and then wring 'em out
Drag me down into your jealousy
Rising to inside your open mouth
Taking out your whole life on me
On me

You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned

Don't tell me to come home, you must be stoned
Won't be wrapped up in your wings that spread with disaster
No, I'm not all those things you might be after
Maybe you're just too stoned to see you're the reason I don't come home
Too faded to see that my heart's growin' blacker
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned
