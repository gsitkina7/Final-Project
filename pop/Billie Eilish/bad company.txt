Three, two, one!

I've got a man that doesn't love me
He's got a girl that doesn't love him
She's got a brother down in Cali
He's got a tattoo for his cousin

Another picture perfect family
Should've known they'd keep bad company
Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't  love me
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)

Mom and dad are getting worried
They've got a man outside the building
He's got a Jag' with tinted windows
He makes a killing for a living

Another picture perfect family

I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
