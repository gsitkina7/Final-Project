I know he loved you a long time ago
I ain't jealous of you, just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't trying to show maturity

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?
I found that picture of you in that green dress
He sure had a good time cleaning up that mess
He found thirty other pieces but he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together, now he knows to keep it off the wall

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Oh, just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart?
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?

In permanent marker
Oh, permanent marker, yeah
