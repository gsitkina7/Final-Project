I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring kinda girl
Hey, yeah, what's the word on you?
Lay low
I'm a mission rebel, angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
I'm poetry
Complicated, simply stated
Hey, yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up, I don't get up
I just get down, yeah

But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

It's raining on Sunday
There's nothin' on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinkin' about you
I bet you're thinkin' of me too
Well, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
