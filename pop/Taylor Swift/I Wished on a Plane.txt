Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
