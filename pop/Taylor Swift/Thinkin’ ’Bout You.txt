Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
Your face jumped right in my way
As things lately do
Oh baby can't you see
The thought of you makes a mess of me
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

And Now I
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you
Oh, ah

I get lost when I drive around town
Thinkin' 'bout your smile
Always ending' up
Your side of town
And I don't know why
Must be somethin' under this hood
Nobody's strong like you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you

Your eyes are the color of
The great big sea
The one I go swimmin' in
Every time you look at me
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you

Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
