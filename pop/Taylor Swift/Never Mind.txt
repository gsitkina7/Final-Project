Look at you, look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you, I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin, and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me, I could go crazy, but I don't
Say it, but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time, everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you, and look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you, I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin, and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me, I could go crazy, but I don't
Say it, but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All I really want to say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and gray?
And I just wish I told you, never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now, but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah
And I could tell you now, but never mind
