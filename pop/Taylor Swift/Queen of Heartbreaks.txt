Sitting around waiting for you all day long
Watching the clock go (tick, tick, tick)
You never even arrived at my palace
I'm still having the best time without you

Even if I hear the words you speak
I have no idea what you mean
I'm the queen of America
You're the prince but if you're the prince
Then you shouldn't have been late
I still hear your voice in the empty throne
I remember the first ring you gave me
But if you set me free finally
Which girl did you run away with?

'Cause I'm the queen of heartbreaks
You don't know what I have that can make you go away
It's the thought that counts for missing you
So if I'm correct then, you might be alone tonight
Even on a Saturday night

Watching our favorite movies
The same ones over and over again
We love horrors and classics
But if we love classics then we just did a classic movie
Remember when you left me

Even if I hear the words you speak
I have no idea what you mean
I'm the queen of America
You're the prince but if you're the prince
Then you shouldn't have been late
I still hear your voice in the empty throne
I remember the first ring you gave me
But if you set me free finally
Which girl did you run away with?

'Cause I'm the queen of heartbreaks
You don't know what I have that can make you go away
It's the thought that counts for missing you
So if I'm correct then, you might be alone tonight
Even on a Saturday Night

You should've been lucky to be married to the queen of heartbreaks
Instead you wasted you're whole life
Count your money, you only get to live once
But you're just a cruel, selfish, prince
Or should I say cheater or monster or anything
Taking over everything
Don't take that stuff away from me
I've only just begun

Play me like a fool
I've known your trick forever
I lived like this forevermore
