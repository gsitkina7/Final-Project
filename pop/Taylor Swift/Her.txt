She's real pretty if you’re into that brunette
Looks good without any makeup on
Green eyes kind of thing
Uh huh
She's spontaneous, she ain't afraid of anything
She’s not the jealous type
She's the type you give a diamond ring

And I came along, just after she walked out
Picking up the pieces 'til I've figured out
There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it’s like you cross it every time
When you can’t stop thinking about her

She came from a really small town
She liked to watch football with you
Well, I'd learn football too, if you wanted me to
Uh huh
She’s really good with babies, she'd be a great mother
She said I should really meet her sometime
Uh huh

It's getting old, I wonder if you've seen
The favorite conversation’s killing me

There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her
Don't you know I was a 4.0 in school?
