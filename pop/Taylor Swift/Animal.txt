Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
So take it easy
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Neon Trees!

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Hush, hush the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Well, I won't sleep tonight
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
