You were what I wanted
When I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
I said, "Let them say we're crazy"
You said, "Let's go fishing tonight"
The midnight moon was blazing, baby
I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mama's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
