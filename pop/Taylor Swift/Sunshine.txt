I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't know what to say
Hello, good day
But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when

He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything
Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh

He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
Yeah, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, he says, he really loves me and he'll do anything

I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know
What that surprise is?
It's love
And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, I'll always remember
This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine
Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshine
