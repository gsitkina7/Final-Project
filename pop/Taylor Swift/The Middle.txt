Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best, try everything you can
Don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away

It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own
So don't buy in love right now
Just be yourself, it doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else

It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright(x2)

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just do your best, do everything you can
Don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say

It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright
