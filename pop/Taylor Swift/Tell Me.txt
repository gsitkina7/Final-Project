It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
But now who are you?
I thought I knew
Your eyes happen now to look right through me
Itâ€™s like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me
Take time to realize
I know that people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say to my face
But you ran away

Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby, even a lie
Yeah, yeah

Tell me what did I do
'Cause, baby, suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
And tell me
And tell me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
And tell me
Tell me
