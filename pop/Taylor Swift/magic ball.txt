It's weird how all of you guys are gone
It lasted for a day, I knew it
The moment I saw his face
I know we wouldn't be together, forever
I don't wanna make this all about me
But I heard something dirty

And that's the words he said
Last time I met him the rain
I met him before I threw him away
Don't take back the words you said
It's funny you're future isn't in a magic ball yet
If you wanna find someone better than me, that's fine
I met the perfect guy in 1926
Wow, you havе just been a bitch
I need more from your lies
Dig deeper and deepеr until I find you're heart

And that's the words he said
Last time I met him in the rain
I met him before I threw him away
Don't take back the words you said
It's funny you're future isn't in a magic ball yet

I swear I met somebody different
Somebody who cares
Someone who loves me
Someone who isn't cruel
Someone that makes me laugh
Well, none of those things are you
And I'd come crashing down
And you'd just sit there alone
While I'll run off by myself
It's the only thing that keeps me alive
That phone call you made to me
I missed it too but leave you behind
The magic ball isn't broken
It just doesn't tell pretty lies
