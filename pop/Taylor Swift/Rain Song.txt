Just had a conversation with the mirror
I ended up not having much to say
Said "Today is for the lovers and the leaders
I hate to tell you, it just ain't your day"
So this is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
And it's a complication with the voices
Rounding all around inside my mind
I used to think this heart had lots of choices
But they all lead to your doorstep every time
This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
So this is my apology
My words, my tears, are all me
Laid out in front of you
Like a grasp for truth
On a Sunday afternoon
This is a song for you
This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
And you'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
Ooh
I still love you
I had a conversation with the mirror
It ended up not having much to say
