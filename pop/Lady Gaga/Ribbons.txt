I'm not bad, I just sound that way!

All the girls, they like their presents like their presents
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive if they're well thought out
Sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line, and give me mine
We like black, white, big, striped, polka-dotted, cafe-lotted
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons
Silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night
We like black, white, big, striped, famous, super-sized ribbons
Don't care what you put inside them
Wrap it all in ribbons
It's the lifestyle that I like
I'll give you yours, you give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up in pretty, pretty ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
Only difference between downtown and uptown
Is therapy and valium
Therapy and valium
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous
Yeah, it's therapy and valium
Therapy and valium

It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up
Wrap...
Wrap them presents up, wrap them presents up
Wrap...
