I don't know why you' hurt, inside
Or what was said to make, you, cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when, you' feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest, greatest thing to me

I don't wa-wanna waste another day
I'm thinking of you, the man of my day
I walk and see you once another day
'Cause when I'm with you, I fall apart
I see your permanently broken heart
Baby, you're the greatest to me
Know, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you' hurt, inside
Or what was said to make, you, cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when, you' feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, i'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest, greatest thing to me
