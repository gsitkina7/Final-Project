This beat is so funny
We made it with their money
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
Yeah
You so fancy
Ooh, ah
Huh
See that girl, watch her go
Red high heels and pretty toes
Silly puddy, dungaroos
Lady's got a killer groove
And you've got a lot to lose

All the famous boys and girls stand around and pose
Everybody knows at The Boom Boom Room
We all take off our clothes
Fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes

Oh baby, don't be shy
Fashion's got a lazy eye
Everybody, let's take off our fancy pants tonight
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
Grab those tight and lacy bottoms
Don't leave home without 'em
Let's take off our fancy pants tonight
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
This beat is so funny
We made it with their money
Hahahahahahahahahahaha

See that boy, watch him go
Blue jeans with an ass like "Whoa"
Philly suddy, sungarood
Monkey's got a killer groove
A girl's got a lot to lose

All the famous boys and girls put it up their nose
Everybody knows in The Boom Boom Room
We all take off our clothes
Fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes

Oh baby, don't be shy
Fashion's got a lazy eye
Everybody, let's take off our fancy pants tonight
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
Grab those tight and lacy bottoms
Don't leave home without 'em
Let's take off our fancy pants tonight
