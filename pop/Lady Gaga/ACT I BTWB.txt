BONSOIR PARIS ! JE VOUS ADORES !
Je.. Ne.. Suis.. Pas.. Une.. Femme..
Je ne suis pas un ALIEN !
Je ne suis pas un homme
I am not. Human
And I’m not a creature of your government, LA FRANCE!
But I am. You
We share the same hopes
We share la meme dreams
Potential
We share this universe
Im everything you love about this world
And, la France i have everything. Vous detestez
That it because you created me
I was Born this way
I have landed here tonight, on G.O.A.T.,
Your French Government Owned Alien Territory in space
I am here for one purpose, to extract as much information. inspiration. Courage. Bravery. Fashion. Art. And musique for all of the French people
Mon français est mexrdique. But i love french, so i will try all night
And I come here to training. And when I leave tonight
Ecoute, mon spectacle est fini. some of you will stand by me for ever
But some of you..
May-be.. betray me
NO! NAH ! STOP! WHO ARE YOU ! STOP ! JUDAAS !

*breathes, act dead*
Who will betray me ? WHO ?

Juda-ah-s
Juda-ah-s
Put your hands in the air, la France !
Cmon ! *jumps*
Mes petits, je vous adores, jump !

When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah *spin*
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down *waves*
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh bcby

Judas, Juda-ah-s
JUUDDAAS ! PARIIS ! HOPEFULLY AH ! ah. Not anymore

In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hccker, prcstitcte, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kc me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you
But something’s pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and
Judas is the demon I cling to. *takes gun*
I CLING TO !

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh bcby. *jumps*
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, bcby
JUST A HOLY FOOL Oh, Oh !
