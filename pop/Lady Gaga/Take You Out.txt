Last week I saw you out
And I knew we would be a match in Heaven
Just the coolest kind of team

I, I know there ain’t no way that we won’t
'Cause we won’t stop 'til we go, go the distance
We’re a distance
Baby, I believe it
I still believe it
And you know we won’t be defeated
In my heart, I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby

I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (football)
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (football)

I've got the feeling that this year could be the one
We're gonna tear it up and burn out everyone

I, I know there ain’t no way that we won’t
'Cause we won’t stop 'tll we go, go the distance
We’re a distance
Baby, I believe it

I still believe it
And you know we won’t be defeated
In my heart, I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby
I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (Football)
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (Football)
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (Football)
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (Football)

New York, London, Paris, Munich
Everybody talk about pop music

I still believe it
And you know won’t be defeated
In my heart, I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby

I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
I still believe it
And you know won’t be defeated
In my heart, I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby

I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
