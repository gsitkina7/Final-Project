I still see your coat hanging on the door
Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite

Don't ask me why I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

You came along I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

Wish I could try, but I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

Cause the ground is breaking
I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy, but it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands out
Gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathing
Baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we're sinking
Baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we are sinking
Cause I just-just gotta-gotta hold (hold)

Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
(Just-just gotta-gotta hold)
Only got one life to live
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me
We need to hold on and hold on and...
Only got one life to live
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me
We need to hold on and hold on and hold on
And hold on
And hold on, and hold on

And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
