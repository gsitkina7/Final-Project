Baby I'm not naive I know you're broken
I know you were once whole but now you're broken
You don't know which part of yours been stolen
But what you're looking for?

You gotta go deep
Deeper than an ocean
You gotta go deep
Deeper than the bluest blue
Listen what I am telling you
You gotta go deep, deep. deep
Past your limit
Deep, deep, deep
Til you really fell it
And I will swim all the way down to you

Baby we all have fear for going under
But you can't drink the rain without some thunder
You must travel far to find God's wonder
What you don't dig, for you can't be discovered

You gotta go deep
Deeper than an ocean
You gotta go deep
Deeper than the bluest blue
Listen what I am telling you
You gotta go deep, deep. deep
Past your limit
Deep, deep, deep
Til you really fell it

And I will swim all the way down to you
