I canâ€™t help myself
I'm in love
And when I get back from outer space
I'm gonna punch him in his face
He's one
He's a bad, bad boy
Got me twisted, uh
If he's the moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar, yeah
When I get to him, run him over with my rocket ship
My eyeliner runs in constellations for you, dear
If only I could reboot my mechanical heart, I'd think clear

Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love?
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man

I've been working and engineering, uh
All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
When my hair is blond but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on him then at least I'm honest
My mascara runs in constellations for you dear, my dear
If only I could space my brain for a minute
I'd think clear

Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love?
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man

Fuel me up, and take me into a place we've never been
He is so unreal
He's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic, rubber man
And I'm relying on, on a shooting star
To get to you my future love, ah-ah
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy
And I'm stuck in his metal rubber eyes
Rubber eyes
My future guy
Huh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
