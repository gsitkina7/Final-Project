Hold me, daddy, real tight
They'll take our picture in the spotlight
Yeah, I know you love that limelight
And how that DJ's spinning tonight (uh-DJ)

Wish it, wash it down
Gonna paint the town pink
We don't care what you think, sorry
Everybody wants to be like us
Filthy glamorous
We know how to party
Sexy ugly
Rock like us silly and gorgeous
Real hot body
Sexy ugly

Hold your mama real tight
She's turning colors in the black light
Sound phobic polite
Don't be afraid to shake that butt right

Wish it, wash it down
Gonna paint the town pink
We don't care what you think, sorry

Everybody wants to be like us
Filthy glamorous
We know how to party
Sexy ugly
Rock like us silly and gorgeous
Real hot body
Sexy ugly
You sex pot, you sex pot
You are a sex pot, you are a sex pot
You sex pot, you sex pot
You are a sex pot, you are a sex pot
You, sex and pot, yeah

Wish it, wash it down
Gonna paint the town pink
We don't care what you think, sorry

Everybody wants to be like us
Filthy glamorous
We know how to party
Sexy ugly
Rock like us silly and gorgeous
Real hot body
Sexy ugly
Be like us
Filthy glamorous
We know how to party
Sexy ugly
Rock like us silly and gorgeous
Real hot body
Sexy ugly
