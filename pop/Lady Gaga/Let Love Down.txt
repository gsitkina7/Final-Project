I can't remember when you looked at me and cried
Said something broke inside of you
Were my best friend
Whatever come our way, you know I'm your girl 'til the end

And when I'll finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day

When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down
Oh, you let me down
Get a little let down
Let it down
I can't remember when you put your hand on mine
But couldn't play in time
When we, yeah, when we're not together
Just sing a little song
Blueberry kisses forever

Yeah, when I'll finally go away (when I'll finally go away)
I know you'll look for me one day
Oh, yeah
It's so sad

When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down
Oh, you let me down
Get a little love down
Let it down

Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't let me down
Oh, don't let me down
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down
Oh, you let me down

Don't let me down
Let it down
Can't let love down
Let it down
Can't let love down
Let it down
