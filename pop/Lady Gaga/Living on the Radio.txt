I've got no friends
I'm my own queen
But I'm living on, living on the radio, that's my dream
Stone river eyes, and a lonely heart
If I'm living on the radio, they won't tear me apart

10 stems and roses on a tree
10 steps, and lonely nights, but you still got me
On the road, road paved in gold
Baby you must believe
Baby you must be free
Keep living on, living on the radio, that's your dream
Baby you've got a friend
And so many little monsters, yeah
Keep living on, living on the radio

And when there's nowhere to go
And all your friends are gone
And you've only got your daddy to call
You can be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio

'Cause you're sure to miss all the caviar
The champagne, and the sold-out shows
But we'll be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio
