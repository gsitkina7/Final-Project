Midnight at the glamour show on a Sunday Night
Everybody drink a lot of whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow
We’re on Burlesque time
But everybody’s got to work tomorrow at nine

Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair
Love me l-love me crazy, but don’t get too attached
This is a brief affair
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity
It’s so good to be (fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else)

Va-va-va-va-vanity
Va-vanity
Va-va-va-vanity

Nothing wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty ’cause this country’s insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine

Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair (oh)
Love me l-love me crazy, but don’t get too attached
This is a brief affair

Look at me
Watcha lookin' at?
Look at me
Watcha starin' at?
Look at me
Watcha lookin' at?
Look at me
Watcha starin' at?

I’m coming around
I’m sipping on Andre, it’s time
I heard the cutie's in the back, start in the p-party line
Let’s dance, quick round
We’re in the vanity house
We’re covered in sequins, diamonds
We're happy ’cause we're shining

Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair (oh)
Love me l-love me crazy, but don’t get too attached
This is a brief affair
