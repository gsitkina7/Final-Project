I was frightened when I made it
They called me in
Walked in through the door
They called me weird
Bitch, now I'm a household name

You've seen the power that I've held
Beauty isn't in the eye of the beholder
It's how you see yourself
You've seen the power that I've held
Now you're about to see what I do next
