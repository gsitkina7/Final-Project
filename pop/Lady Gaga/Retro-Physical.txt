We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So everybody in here can stop snoring
We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So everybody in here can stop snoring
We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So everybody in here can stop snoring

Letâ€™s get into trouble, lots of trouble
Rockstar, you know how to rock hard
Hello, midnight lover-lover
Hold that lady tighter
Shoot that bullet through her
My heart beats just like a cherry soda in the summer
Go, go, go
Don't be difficult about it
Get off it

Off the wall (Get your ass)
Off the wall (Throw that girl)
Against the wall, retro-physical
Off the wall (Get your ass)
Off the wall (Work that boy)
So sexual, retro-physical

Let's get down to business, funny business
In the middle of the night he starts to get feisty
Let's get into trouble, lots of trouble
There are killers and blonde bunnies
They dance for money

My heart beats just like a cherry soda in the summer
Go, go, go
Don't be difficult about it
Get off it
Off the wall (Get your ass)
Off the wall (Throw that girl)
Against the wall, retro-physical
Off the wall (Get your ass)
Off the wall (Work that boy)
So sexual, retro-physical

Everyone is famous
Running 'round real aimlessly
We dance for the garage team
In between the spaces, happiness can trace it down
We're not gonna leave this town
In between the spaces, happiness can trace it down
We're not gonna leave this town
