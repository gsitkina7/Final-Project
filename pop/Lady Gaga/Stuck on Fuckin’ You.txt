Got no plans, got no clothes
Got no piano, we got no shows
No, I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Got no flights outta here
Got no TV shows until next year
No, I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you
Baby, you’re my liquor
I’m addicted to you
So I’ll just be stuck on, stuck on fucking you
Stuck on fucking you

I don’t ever want just another boy or a girl
Baby, you and I, baby, you and I could change the world
I don’t ever want just another boy or a girl to love
I’m stuck, stuck on you

Got all night, no cameras
We've got no champagne but we've got drugs
No, I've got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Purple sheets, cymbal clock
Going to spend my time rocking on top
Yea, I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Baby, you’re my Johnny Walker
Baby, it’s true
So I’ll just be stuck on, stuck on fucking you
Stuck on fucking you
I don’t ever want just another boy or a girl
Baby, you and I, baby, you and I could change the world
I don’t ever want just another boy or a girl to love
I’m stuck, stuck on you

Got no plans, got no flights
While we’re here, no TV shows
But we got mice in the kitchens
But we don’t care 'cause we’re in love
Get in the shower
I’ll meet you there
I bought you some hippie shit from the Deli down the stairs, oh yeah
Love it when my man smells so good

Don’t forget me baby
Don’t forget me when I leave and go on tour
'Cause I know your life would be a snore
You’d be all stuck fucking this hooker-whore
This hooker, whore

Got no nothing
You’re in the next room
You fell asleep on my tour bus while me and Fernando and Paul and Justin and Dave are making music
But I miss you
The fridge is broke
And we're drinking warm champagne
But we don’t care cause we’re in Minnesota
And we’re sold out show again
And it's a sold show again

Okay, just stop here, I could go on forever
