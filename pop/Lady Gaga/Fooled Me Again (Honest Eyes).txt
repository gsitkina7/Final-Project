It's been a hard day
Harder night
The rockstar's girlfriend
She lost the fight
Well, it’s alright, baby, I'm nobody’s mother
When you don't want the last cigerette to be over

You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes
It’s been two days since he left home
She dried her eyes
Picked up her microphone
She sang, "It’s alright, baby."
I'm nobody’s mother
But I dont want this last cigerette to be over

You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes


You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of effin lies
Again, oh, and fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of shh... eyes
Again, honest, honest, you're so freaking honest
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
You're so full of it
At least your shh... honest
Eyes
