It's off, it's on
The party's just begun
Take off, and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna grow up

'Cause when the lights come on
You lift me up, and I feel strong
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Rely, or run
Get the bad guy's gun
I love the songs that you play
And I don't care what they say
'Cause I was born this way

And I hear you scream, I hit the top of the stage
And close my eyes, and know exactly who I am
Oh-oh

And I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living, but I wanna be in love
And I, I wanna be with you
This one's for you
