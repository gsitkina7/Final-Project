I need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smokin up my way
You get me through these cha-changing skies
I don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
You get me through these cha-changing skies
Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

And I don't wanna be the kind to cry
I wanna dance right through the night
You get me through these cha-changing skies
Know that I am not emotional
It's just that I don't wanna fall without my parachute, tonight
Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
