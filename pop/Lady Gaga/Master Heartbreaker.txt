Girl's muscles in my bones
But I'm too poor to pay the penance
You know the cadilac's her man
But I don't have a licence
I drive, I'm mean
Boys that I choose
Never come out clean
I doubt you are sleeping
And dreaming of me on your own
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't
Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice
Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker
Oh this devil in my mouth
And when we kiss I'll pull him out
I think my love is sworn
Up with my rose with stinging thorns
I kiss, I'm mean
Boys like you
They never come out clean
And while you are cursing
And crying 'cause I sent you home
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't
Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice
Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker
Huh, huh huh, huh
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, huh, huh, huh
Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's, no, she's not nice
Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
