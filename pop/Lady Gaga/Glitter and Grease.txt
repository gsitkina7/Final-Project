Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around

Rub that glitter and grease, he loves it

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around

Start it, pump it, wash it, bump it
Rub that glitter and grease, he loves it
Me so grimy, make her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behindy
Start it, pump it, wash it, bump it
Rub that glitter and grease, he loves it
Me so grimy, make her shiny
There's more glitter and grease behindy

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around, grease around
