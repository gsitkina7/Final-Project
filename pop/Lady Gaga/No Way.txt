(Happy Ending...)

I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you were intertwined
Even though her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else, and you were both to blame

Don't say a word
I'm sure that it won't be enough to erase what I know
Just happens now, what dreams are made of
This is my house, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

Thought that I saw something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought that there's no way you would do that to me
And then last week, when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold

And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause when I have those, it isn't real like this one is
This is my heart, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay
Get your things and go
You can take the dinner left over from last night
I made you your favorite goodbye

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay
