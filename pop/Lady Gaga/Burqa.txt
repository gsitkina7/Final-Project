I killed my boyfriend and
Left him in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood

Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?

Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
