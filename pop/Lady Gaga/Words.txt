I won't break down today
Another brick's in my way of shadows
The promises they made
Regret themselves, and say "this is too hard"

Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

Whenever you're afraid, or someone's far away
Never give in
'Cause happily we'll reign when consequences change
Believe you can win

Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words and be gone
Your words and be gone
I'll take your words and be gone
