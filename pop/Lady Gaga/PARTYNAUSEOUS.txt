Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz?
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby smoke it up 'til we're high
(Now Jump)

In a way, exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
Talking 'bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
