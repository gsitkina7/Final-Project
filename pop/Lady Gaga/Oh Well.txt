Where did they go?
Where did everybody go?
I wanna know
We could've tried
Why did everybody cry if you weren't mine?

And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Can't find the words
But hey, man, everybody hurts
When it doesn't work

And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well

Your love drowned us in a hole
You never ever wanted her to grow
To grow
Oh, oh
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
If everything is gonna change, was it worth it?
Oh, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
You weren't strong enough, oh well, for me...
Oh well
Oh well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well
