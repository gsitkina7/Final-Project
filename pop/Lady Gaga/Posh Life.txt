He went to them, they turned away
He just wanted something to eat, a place to love, a place to pray
In God we trust, and it's okay
He said, "I'm black, latin, and gay...
I went to them, they turned away."

Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave, until you're bleeding
Where life is holding you hard in a place that it don't want to be
You gotta posh life
'Cause life is all you need
We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

Posh life
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed

Grew up north of the Florida Bay
Nineteen, moved to the big city to find a dream, to find a way
Ooh, burning concrete of lower east
Inscribing sharpie William's "H"
Passionately only serving him, yeah

Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave, until you're bleeding
Where life is holding you hard in a place that it don't want to be
You gotta posh life
'Cause life is all you need

We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

We live a posh life
A posh life
Posh life, until we bleed
Posh like
We live a posh life
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed

This ain't no chapel, ain't no Pauper's prison
We love this posh life for just one reason
We got each other when the church ain't giving
We love this posh life for just one reason
We live a posh life
The world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

We live a posh life
A posh life
Posh life, until we bleed
Posh like
We live a posh life
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed
