She does a dirty dance
To a song about a bad romance
Meet a damaged girl, meet a damaged guy
He's a local star, stealing glares of her across the bar
See a damaged girl, see a damaged guy

I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh, oh

They were neighbours then
Back then, they werеn't even friends
Watch a damagеd girl, watch a damaged guy
Fearing stories when a couple crashed, dangerous affair
Watching them tear up, the DJ cries, yeah

I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling

I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh, oh
