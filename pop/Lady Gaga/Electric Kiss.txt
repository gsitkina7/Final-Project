We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed, and losing all control

We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

Fame is our felony
We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms, and know what they must do

We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss
