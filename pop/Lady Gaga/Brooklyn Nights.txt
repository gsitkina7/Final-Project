I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
I always thought even though
We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored?
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free

It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work (Make it work)
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want our last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
