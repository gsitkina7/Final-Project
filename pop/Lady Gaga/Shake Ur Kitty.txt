Ow, come here boy

I met a drummer last week at a pool bar down
B-by the shore
With a body like that and your stonewashed eyes
I want you more

He cried, "Mother, what'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother, mother, mother's for babies, call me kitty."
Yeah, shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

Shake your shake
Shake shake
Shake your sh-shake
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake

I took a drummer by the hand to the jukebox
Then we hit the floor
With your Van Halen pin and your dark side burns
I want you more

He cried, "Mother, what'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother, mother, mother's for babies, call me kitty."
Yeah, shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

You never call me by my name, but I still want you
You play some pretty tricky games, but I still want you
Your best friend drives a fancy car, but I still want you
You're working every hour, but, but I still want you, yeah

If you see a girl this pretty shake her, shake her, shake her kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty shake it, shake it, shake that kitty

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
If you see a girl this pretty shake her, shake her, shake her kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty shake it, shake it, shake that kitty

Shake your shake
Shake it, shake
Shake it, shake
Shake it, shake
Meow
Uh, uh-oh
