There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know it isn't time
But would you be m-mine?
We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the bar
So in a ménage à trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now, I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

There it goes
You stole my soul, and so
'Cause sweetheart, no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
They're occupied
Tell me you'll be mine
Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of ménage à trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Could you be m-mine?
Yeah

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now, I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone with this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now, I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

Fever, fever, yeah
