Technology, technology, technology
C-c-conceived by the Haus of Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga
Everybody say hello to Space Cowboy please!
How you doin'? Oh, oh, oh
This song is called Egyptian Lover!

I see your boy, but he don't do it like me
He's not that type, I see it in your eyes
You need a freak, someone to keep a secret
A boy like me who knows what's on your mind
You make it hot, I see you looking at me
Stop wasting time and come with me tonight
Stop spending money on me, stop wasting time
If you're coming home with me you're running out of time
My Egyptian, my Egyptian lover
There is no other (There is no other)
My Egyptian lover, my Egyptian lover, my Egyptian lover
There is no other (There is no other)
