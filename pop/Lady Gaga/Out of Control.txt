Hey babe
I'm feelin' something kinda crazy
I know that we got something special, boy
But lately, I've been feelin' naughtier than usual

You see I
I need a love that's crazy, don't you see
I'm looking for someone who can handle me
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so
I'm sorry when I met'cha that I did not know
That you and me, we're kind of incomplete
Need someone the same in-love with me
Give it up, put it up
Not enough, not enough, not enough
I need it
Out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control

Baby, I'm a toy
Let's play out of control
Cuz I want you more
When your out of control
BABY BABY BABY!

You see I
Need a love that's crazy, don't you see
I'm looking for someone who can handle me
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so
I'm sorry when I met you that I did not know
You and me, we're kinda incomplete
Need someone who's the same, in love with me
Give it up, put it out
Not enough, not enough
Not enough, I mean it
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control

You see I want you here right now
No hesitate
Donâ€™t pull me down
I love you more in my wavelength, in the night
(Cuz you want me
Cuz you want me
Cuz you want me)

Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
