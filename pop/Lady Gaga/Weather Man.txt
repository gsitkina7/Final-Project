Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

The Sun is gone, babe, no more warm days
It's kind of crazy when I think of some of our memories
Taking trips with you when we needed time
Thought I was busy but I'm not having you in my life
We were closer than ever (Ever)
You were as sexy as the day that I met you (I met you, yeah)
We were closer than ever (Ever)
I used to think that we'd always be together, and then the weather

I swear the thunder came and brought the rain
Then the lightning struck, babe, we were never the same
(Never the same)
I should've seen the signs way in the sky
But I was blind, now I realise

You brought the weather, man
You are my weather man
You brought the weather, man
Tell me the weather, man

Boy, you brought the storm, you were doing me wrong
And now I'm sitting in the rain writing you this song
Colder than the frost, girl, you left me lost
Tryna live my life, how I'm supposed to turn this off?

We were closer than ever (Ever)
You were as sexy as the day that I met you (I met you, baby)
We were closer than ever (Ever)
I used to think that we'd always be together, and then the weather
I swear the thunder came and brought the rain
Then the lightning struck, babe, we were never the same
(Never the same)
I should've seen the signs way in the sky
But I was blind, now I realise

You brought the weather, man
You are my weather man
You brought the weather, man
Tell me the weather, man (Tell me the weather, baby)

Boy, you brought the storm
Boy, you brought the storm
You brought that hurricane
I never thought you'd do me wrong (Never do me wrong)
Boy, you brought the storm (Yeah)
Boy, you brought the storm (Oh)
You brought that hurricane
I never thought you'd do me wrong
Baby, don't lie (Baby) baby, don't cheat (Hey)
In my mind, it's broken, boy, I'ma do me
Baby, don't lie, baby, don't cheat
Weather man, whether or not, I'ma do me
Oh, oh, baby
I swear the thunder came and brought the rain
Then the lightning struck, babe, we were never the same
(Never the same)
I should've seen the signs way in the sky
But I was blind, now I realise

You brought the weather, man
You are my weather man (You know it)
You brought the weather, man
Tell me the weather, man
You brought the weather, man (Man, man)
You are my weather man (Man, man)
You brought the weather, man (Man, man)
Tell me the weather, man (Man, man)

Oh, baby, you brought the weather, man
Oh, baby, you are the weather man
