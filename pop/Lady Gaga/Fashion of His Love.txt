I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be as fitting as McQueen
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to be grand
Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!

No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through
I was made for you

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love

I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him...
Oh, yeah

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
