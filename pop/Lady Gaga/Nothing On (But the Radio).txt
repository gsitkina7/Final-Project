I'm calling 'cause I need you
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get
And you know how good I can be
I'm calling just to tell you
Get here, I'll make it all worth your while
I can make you some food
Boy, and then I can make you smile

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight
You better get here soon
O-or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

When you get here, boy, we can dance
My hands in the back pockets of your pants
I've turned the lights down low
And I've got nothing on but the radio

Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight (oh-oh, nothing)
Nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight
Wait 'til I get my hands on you (oh-oh, nothing)

Nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight
