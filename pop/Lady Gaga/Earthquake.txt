What if I were to leave you
But then you fell back in love with me?

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you

If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
