Yeah

Blueberry kisses
My lips, they miss his, oh, yeah
Where did you go now?
Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses

I told you baby, I'd love you maybe
But you stopped the clock the second time around
I need you around, 'round, 'round (Blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (Blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (Blueberry kisses)
'Round and around
'Round and around, and around

Blueberry kisses
The muffin man, he misses them kisses, yeah
Where did they go now?
Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses

I told you baby, I'd L-O-V you maybe
But you stopped the clock the second time around
Yeah, I know it's crazy
But I've been feeling lately that I need you around-ou-ou-ou-ound

I need you around, 'round, 'round (Blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (Blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (Blueberry kisses)
