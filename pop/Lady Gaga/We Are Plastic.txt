We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

Here we go round on the boulevard
Top cutting the cake till the sugar flow, stop, don't stop (it's a record)
Drip drip drip, baby watch me melt
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help me stop, can't stop (it's a record)

Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

Wire that girl for the electronic
Underground scene where the beat is chronic, yeah
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique), oh yeah
Drip drip drip, baby watch me melt
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help, it's bad, so bad (it's a record)

Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We gotta synthetic situation
And we dance with no intermission
Mister shouldn't have kissed her
Before the rock show was o-o-over
Here we go-go, sir
We're making time, it's a record, record, record

Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
