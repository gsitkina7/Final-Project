Who's that boy boy, I like that boy boy
Who hangs out with his friends go home play with his toy toy
I know a girl girl, he'd like to twirl twirl
The kind of girl who loves him and complete his world world

I like to pose pose in all your clothes clothes
And text you pictures of places I never show show
When I get home home, and I'm alone-lone
I just can't wait to feel you vibrate on my phone phone
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)

It's hard to sleep sleep, without that beep beep
I need something to know that you're thinking of me me
I think of you you, and what I do do
I go in circles but it's no fun without you you

Baby you know know, you left a mark mark
Do you remember when we taped it in the dark dark
I talk for free free, and honestly-ly
You know I love it when you pop my blackberry-ry

And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
Baby, you know that I have never felt this way before
'Cause when you're gone I have these feelings that I can't ignore
Don't get the wrong idea, just what am I supposed to do
When all I have left to remember are pictures

And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
