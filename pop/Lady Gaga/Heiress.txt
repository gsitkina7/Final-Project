J'adore les femmes riches, oui-oui
J'adore les femmes riches

Saturday, I'm wakin' up
Hungover, my coffee cup
Turn on my TV
Wish that, wishing that was me
I'd like to buy them shoes
Yeah, me love them Jimmy Choos
It's mad expensive when you're livin' like a princess
Gossip columns, magazines
Places they go to be seen
So many celebrities
Can't help myself, I wanna be

Damn, it's good to be rich and famous
Just like Paris
Page Six, A-list, gorgeous, face it
Everybody loves an heiress
Damn, it's nice to have cars and money
When you're twenty
Bel Air, blonde hair, Greek shipping heir
Everybody loves an heiress

Uh-huh, that's hot
Steamin' like teapots
Uh-huh, that's hot
Steamin' like teapots

I'd be one if I could
The sexy girl in Hollywood
They look so pretty
Young and livin' in the city
Tabloids all over it
Everyone is talkin' shit
One week you're the talk
Next week, "Who the hell is that broad?"
Gossip columns, magazines
