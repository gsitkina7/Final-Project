Hey there, weatherman
What’s your name?
Hey, hey
In this corporation
Your prediction’s a high roller’s game
Put your hands together for the pony scene
There’s a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Hear all the boys karaoke scream
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
Reel cool

Get your cute thing out of my flo', Joe
Baby, watch yourself and the records, you know
We don’t mess around
When it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
Keep it reel cool

Hey there, weathergirl
What’s your name?
She’s some kind of tramp
With fuzzy hands and a smoking chain

Put your hands together for the pony scene
There’s a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke screen
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
Keep that shit reel cool

Get your cute thing out of my flo', Joe
Baby, watch yourself and the records, you know
