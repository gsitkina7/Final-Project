It's too much a mess and a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

I can't live with you, yes it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar
And you always wanna hold my hand

But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Don't be, don't be

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
