When the little blue bird who has never said a word starts to sing spring, spring
When the little bluebell in the bottom of the dell starts to ring ding-ding
When the little blue clerk in the middle of his work starts a tune to the moon up above
It is nature, that's all, simply telling us to fall in love

And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Fins
Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Take it, Brian
Mmm
Yeah

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em, I know
Why ask if shad do it - Waiter, bring me "shad roe"
In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Let's do it, let's fall in love
