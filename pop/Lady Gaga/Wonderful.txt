If I fell in love with you, would you understand me, dear?
Love is weird
I colored you a valentine
Struggled just to stay inside the lines
I lose my mind

I really can't believe I lost myself again

Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am
I wrote a song about your eyes
Ate a slice of cherry pie
I cried all night
On a bench inside the park
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark
I'll never stop

I really can't believe I lost myself again

Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

Baby, take me for a ride
Maybe get a little high in a place we have never been
Time is nothing but a line
We leave everything behind
It'd be so wonderful, wonderful
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

(Looking for something crazy)
Wonderful I am (beautiful nothing, now)
I am, I am (I'm talking in circles again)
It's killing me, boy, yeah
I am, I am
You'll know how wonderful I am
Wonderful I am
Wonderful I
