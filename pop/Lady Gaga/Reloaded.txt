Baby, I've got a lot of questions
You better listen up, please
I wanna know what you want and need
To charge up your batteries
You got the flow and the intentions
Boy, but have you got the miles? (Got the miles, got the miles)
Show me you got the ammunition
That you're good for-for a while (For a while, for a while)

Charge it up (Charge it up now)
'Cause babe, you could be mine
I need a real soldier
Need you to reload it, bring a reloader
Charge it up (Charge it up now)
'Cause babe, I'm one of a kind
I need a real soldier
Need you to reload it, bring a reloader
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)

You b-better rest up your energy
You better reserve yourself
'Cause tonight, I'm expecting to get plenty
And I won't-won't do it myself
Conserve your juices 'cause I'm gonna
Take you on a marathon
I'm not ridiculous, I'm just a girl
Who likes a man who can go long (Can go long, can go long)

Charge it up (Charge it up now)
'Cause babe, you could be mine
I need a real soldier
Need you to reload it, bring a reloader
Charge it up (Charge it up now)
'Cause babe, I'm one of a kind
I need a real soldier
Need you to reload it, bring a reloader
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)

Baby, you can check yourself
I promise genuinely
That I'm gonna do you right
And I won't complain
Unless you're buggin'
Canâ€™t handle my loving
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Uh, yo momma, get low momma
Hit the flow momma, rock like Obama
Mad like Osama, I'ma, with the drama
I got the whole life, if you got the torch (Sup!)
Hey, my man, run from me, man (Say what)
Hey, my man, run from me (Say what)
Hold up, 'fore this room blow up
I'ma release the clip and reload up, uh

Charge it up (Charge it up now)
'Cause babe, you could be mine
I need a real soldier
Need you to reload it, bring a reloader
Charge it up (Charge it up now)
'Cause babe, I'm one of a kind
I need a real soldier
Need you to reload it
Bring a reloader
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
Reloaded-loaded (Lo-oaded, lo-oaded)
