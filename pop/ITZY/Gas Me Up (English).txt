Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas me up
Let's bring it
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas me up
I'm gonna tell you I do what I do
My expression, tone, one minute before backstage
That time, I felt neither trembling or excited
Sometimes I'm getting nervous, but I trust myself
I hated doing it in moderation, my eyes stretched endlessly
I'll enjoy it and know the results, fo' shizzle
Well like one plus one equals two is more accurate
You know this is how I roll

So put it down, yuh
Yeah, yeah
Leave it to me, the moment of light is on
Yeah, yeah
I'm already ready
A moderate tension, I want it
The spotlight turns on, I want it
Okay, go up slowly (Oh)

Feel it, I'll take it all out
Listen, how are you? okay (Go)
I'll make it lit, lit, I gotta gas me up
They'll tell me, wig, wig, I gotta gas me up
Especially when I do it my way
When it's new, I don't do it roughly (No)
I'll make it lit, lit, I gotta gas me up
They'll tell me, wig, wig, I gotta gas me up (Hear me now)

Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas me up
Let's bring it
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas me up

Look back, this is the time I prepared for today
Creating a warm atmosphere
One by one with my squad, hey
The shouts I hear is getting louder
Anyone can compare them with glance
Even if I accidentally sprain my ankle
And it won't come out as B-cut
Well like one plus one equals two is more accurate
No changing, I do what I do

So put it down, yuh
Yeah, yeah
Leave it to me, the moment you step off your foot
Yeah, yeah
Exhaling once
Anticipation towards me, I want it
Growing music, I want it
Okay, go up slowly (Oh)

Feel it, I'll take it all out
Listen, how are you? okay (Go)
I'll make it lit, lit, I gotta gas me up
They'll tell me, wig, wig, I gotta gas me up
Especially when I do it by myself
When it's new, I don't do it roughly (No)
I'll make it lit, lit, I gotta gas me up
They'll tell me, wig, wig, I gotta gas me up (Hear me now)

Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas me up
Let's bring it
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas me up
