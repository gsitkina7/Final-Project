Turn it up, u-u-up
Turn it up
Ra ta ta ta!
Turn it up, u-u-up
Turn it up

I’m born to be full of fun
But still I’m only seventeen
I’m busy having fun, my replying behind in
Well made worries are beyond any means
Whoa, move up faster faster
Whoa, gettin’ louder louder
Whoa, it’s okay if it was funny, that’s all
Until then, don’t ask no questions

Rude or what
With those clumsy words
Can’t let you kill my vibe
That’s a no, no
Sorry, I beg your pardon
If you wanted to me to wither away
I would have told you I told ya
That’s a no, no

Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Ah! Uh-uh ah
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Do what I want, say what I wanna
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Ah! Uh-uh ah
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Do what I want, say what I wanna

Hit that thang like a drum, ta-ta
Rum pa-pa-pum, pa-pa-pum-pum-pum
Stay up all night, stay up
Dance and my body perfectly rid on the rhythm
Blow that thang like a brass, bam-bam
Rum pa-pa-pum, pa-pa-pum-pum-pum
For my dance to not stop
Say that's a no, no, that-that's a no, no

You think that you know me?
You can think what you want
I respect you, but hey you
Don’t ever cross that line
My effort like bust down
One by one get together
ICY-ly flash, it’s dazzling, ping

Rude or what
With those clumsy words
Can’t let you kill my vibe
That’s a no, no
Sorry, I beg your pardon
If you wanted to me to wither away
I would have told you I told ya
That's a no, no

Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Ah! Uh-uh ah
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Do what I want, say what I wanna
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Ah! Uh-uh ah
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Do what I want, say what I wanna

If you ever wanted me to fall
It’s a pity but that’s no, I’m sorry
I’m gonna keep singing
I’m gonna keep dancing
There’s nothing to be scared of for me

Hit that thang like a drum, ta-ta
Rum pa-pa-pum, pa-pa-pum-pum-pum
Stay up all night, stay up
Dance and my body perfectly rid on the rhythm
Blow that thang like a brass, bam-bam
Rum pa-pa-pum, pa-pa-pum-pum-pum
For my dance to not stop
Say that's a no, no, that-that's a no, no

Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Ah! Uh-uh ah
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
That's a no, no
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
Ah! Uh-uh ah
Woo! Ah ya ya ya ya
That's a no, no
