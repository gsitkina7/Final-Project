Yeah
Hey! Hey!
La-da-da-da
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Louder, louder
Hey! Hey!
La-da-da-da
Hey! Hey!
Louder, louder
Mwah!

Hey, tell me once more
Talk again, so it can be heard in my ears
Let me hear you, this is definitely not a joke
Listen up, listen up, listen up
Come closer, closer babe
What are you so afraid of?
Yes, be more confident with yourself
That’s more, I like that

Everyone’s the same, everyone in the same way
Is not being able to mix in without confidence
I can promise you
That you won’t be able to hide your feelings in the end, ay
Heating up heart
The color redder than the sun
I can easily distinguish if it’s real or fake
La-la-la-la-la

Don’t be afraid, don’t worry
What’s so important about how it is seen?
Show the passion in you clearly
So I can feel it

Louder, louder
Shout it out louder
Sorry, I can’t hear you
Tell me clearly
Everything you want
Shout it out louder
It’s too soon to give up
Why are you hesitating?
Let me hear your real voice

Blalala, don’t make me me me
Repeat what I said said said
Sorry, but nobody will notice it in the end
If you keep this up, ay
Mind that gets more nervous
Keeps getting more insecure
It’s simple, there’s one way, try or cry
La-la-la-la-la

In case you might get rejected, skip
Worry in advance and hurts your head, skip
What are you going to do if you won’t do this or that?
So what? So what?
Don’t read my face and say it, speak out
I like that, I like that
That attitude is more appealing

Don’t be afraid, don’t worry
What’s so important about how it is seen?
Show the passion in you clearly
So I can feel it

Louder, louder
Shout it out louder
Sorry, I can’t hear you
Tell me clearly
Everything you want
Shout it out louder
It’s too soon to give up
Why are you hesitating?
Let me hear your real voice

Baby, please speak
A little louder
More, louder, more, louder
So I can hear it
Speak louder
Once more
More, louder, more, louder
I’ll listen to anything

If you don’t now, then it will pass
What you’re waiting for
I can’t wait, you know
Straighten up your shrunk shoulder and stand up
Make it louder, baby

Louder, louder
Shout it out louder
Sorry, I can’t hear you
Tell me clearly
Everything you want
Shout it out louder
It’s too soon to give up
Why are you hesitating?
Let me hear your real voice
