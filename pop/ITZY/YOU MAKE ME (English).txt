Bad girl? Yeah that’s right
I’m not easy so don’t bother poking at me
A thing like love isn’t fun
Blah blah boring

Who’s that boy, who the heck are you
That make me pay attention to you
I’m not comparable to anything
Auto filter even visual, everything

Don’t mind!
Things, they will all blabber about when they see how hip I am
All right
I don’t care, whatever they say
It’s what I’ve always been saying
But when I see you, I can’t continue my words for some reason
Oh my!
You make me, you make me
You make me speechless

Speechless
You make me, you make me
You make me speechless
Speechless
You make me, you make me
You make me speechless

Jealousy among childish kids
Just filter them out coolly, no mercy
No matter how you aggravate me
It doesn’t affect me

Who’s that boy, will you stop now?
I only do what I want to do
Yeah I know you’re quite different, anything
Eyes, face, gestures, speech, everything

Don’t mind!
Things, they will all blabber about when they see how hip I am
All right
I don’t care, whatever they say
It’s what I’ve always been saying
But when I see you, I can’t continue my words for some reason
Oh my!
You make me, you make me
You make me speechless

The unfamiliar attraction that I feel for the first time
This feeling that I somehow want to know about
Still, if you go ahead of me, then well
As everybody knows me
It will be a troublesome misunderstanding. You see?

Speechless
You make me, you make me
You make me speechless
Speechless
You make me, you make me
You make me speechless
