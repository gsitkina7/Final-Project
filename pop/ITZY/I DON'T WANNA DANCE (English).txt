I don't wanna dance
I don't wanna dance

No thanks, the boring facial expression again
What about it, the fat lie, nope
You already know it, bad type
The most interesting thing is ITZY time
(ICY) You keep getting curious and get attracted, we’re somewhat different
Shh, oh don’t tell me what to do

More honestly, more honestly, more honestly, more
You don’t avoid it, you don’t avoid it, you don’t avoid it, you
More freely, more freely, more freely, more
Hmm are you hiding something?

I don't wanna dance
If you're not gonna dance
Neoreul kkeonael chance
I bounce, I bounce
I don't wanna dance
If you're not gonna dance
Nareul ttara dance
I bounce, I bounce

Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
I bounce, I bounce
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
I bounce, I bounce

Just pop in, pop in
Unlock, unlock it, lock it
Feel free, we friends
Till when are you going to hide yourself?
Stop trying, what are they saying
Ignore all prickly stares
What are you so hesitating so much for? (Hmm)
I absolutely won’t move first (Yo!)

Yo don’t hide yourself, don’t hide yourself, don’t hide yourself, you
Hmm are you listening to me?

I don't wanna dance
If you're not gonna dance
Neoreul kkeonael chance
I bounce, I bounce
I don't wanna dance
If you're not gonna dance
Nareul ttara dance
I bounce, I bounce

Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
I bounce, I bounce
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
I bounce, I bounce

Don’t look for concerns, they are not here
Come follow me running ah come on
All the place that our feet lands is our stage now
Let’s dance crazily, bo-bo-bo-bo-bounce!

Go confidently, confidently, confidently
Lo louder, lo louder, lo louder
Above the sky, higher in the sky, higher in the sky, higher
Hmm, let’s do this again

I don't wanna dance
If you're not gonna dance
Neoreul kkeonael chance
I bounce, I bounce
I don't wanna dance
If you're not gonna dance
Nareul ttara dance
I bounce, I bounce

Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
I bounce, I bounce
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
Oleh-oh-eh-oh
I bounce, I bounce

I don't wanna dance
