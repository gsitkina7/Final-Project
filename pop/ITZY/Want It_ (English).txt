Hey! Want what’s real?
Come here, secretly
Wanna play?
I want you, want you, want you
ITZY!

We gon’ run this town like we ain’t got no tomorrow
20 carat diamond, it’s gonna blind you
Can’t nobody hold us down we fly where we wanna
Fly where we wanna, whether we try or not

We a star, Queen boulevard, we live how we wanna
I don’t care what people think this is our persona
You’ve never tasted our style we second to nada
Hot like a lava, fresh like Havana

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, woo!

Hey! Want what’s real?
Come here, secretly
Wanna play?
I want you, want you, want you

We ain’t got no time to sleep, the crowd always want us
Cooler than you think, hot the sun always on us
Everybody makin’ noise but we gon get louder
You wanna know, don’t you? Curious, aren’t you?

Now rock your body to this beat and open your heart
What’s next? We transcend all your expectations
Everyone, go crazy, lose your mind, Go cray like no other
Dance if you wanna, rage if you gonna
