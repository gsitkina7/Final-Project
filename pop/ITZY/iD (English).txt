Woo!
ID, ID, ID
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) Hey...
Tell me your ID

Twenty-four seven, where the hell are you?
What are you doing?
I'm frustrated, there's no reply
You're hippity hoppity hop (Where you at?)
One step, two step and four
Curious move
Let me be honest with you
I be like umm

Being nervous means I like you
Pretend you don't care, that's an obvious lie
Look, look, look
Like this and that, it's obvious
Why don't you know?
Ain't no girls like I do

Double trouble, this is about you and me
Face to face, perhaps a nervous game
Let it go, go, go
I'm attracted to you
I want to know everything
Tell me your ID

I want to know everything from beginning to end
Tell me, tell me your ID, ID, ID, ID
Only you and I know, yeah
I want you to tell me everything
Tell me your ID, ID, ID, nah

Hey, ID
So tell me your ID, ID, ID
Hey (Hey!), ID, ID (ID!)
I'll do whatever I want, I'll do what I'll do

Mama said I'm being selfish
Oh no no, why is that a problem?
Find out what you want to know, I know
Take a good look at me, my proud walking
The way I walk along the runway
Tell me yours and I'll show you mine
Ah yeah yeah yeah

It's not over till it's over (Woo)
If you're curious, that means you're interested
No more blah, blah, blah
Don't listen to them
What's wrong with you?
Ain't no girls like I do

Double trouble, this is about you and me
Face to face, perhaps a nervous game
Let it go, go, go
I'm attracted to you
I want to know everything
Tell me your ID

I want to know everything from beginning to end
Tell me, tell me your ID, ID, ID, ID
Only you and I know, yeah
I want you to tell me everything
Tell me your ID, ID, ID, nah

Just stop for a second, like slow motion
Every scene is full of you
The more I know, the more I wonder about you
Listen up, listen up
Ain't no girls like I do (Yeah!)

Boy tell me who you are, I wanna know (Hey!)
I'm curious about you, tell me your ID
Head to toes, I want it (Hey! Hey!)
Inside and out (You got this)
I'm looking for you, tell me your ID

I want to know everything from beginning to end
Tell me, tell me your ID, ID, ID, ID
Only you and I know, yeah
I want you to tell me everything
Tell me your ID, ID, ID, nah

Hey, ID
So tell me your ID, ID, ID
Hey (Hey!), ID, ID (ID!)
Tell me your ID
