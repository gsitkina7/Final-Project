Looking good, I look so fresh
The stress thrown inside of the room
Hey, would you excuse me
For today it’s first class

Say what you want
Do in our way
Never can stop us
Now we’re coming to you

Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Even I don’t know where it would go, enjoy it ting ting
Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Everything you only imagined, cheerfully ting ting
Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Even I don’t know where it would go, enjoy it ting ting
Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Everything you only imagined, cheerfully ting ting

New kicks for today
Slightly draped sunglasses
Pose, we lit
Camera flash that flashes out

Say what you want
Do in our way
Never can stop us
Now we’re coming to you

Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Even I don’t know where it would go, enjoy it ting ting
Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Everything you only imagined, cheerfully ting ting
Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Even I don’t know where it would go, enjoy it ting ting
Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Everything you only imagined, cheerfully ting ting

Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Even I don’t know where it would go, enjoy it ting ting
Ting ting ting as you feel, ting ting ting at will
Everything you only imagined, cheerfully ting ting
