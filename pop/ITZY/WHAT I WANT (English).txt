I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Mm-ah)
I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Mm-ah)

Pick you up, I put you in my heart
Hesitance is not my type
No matter how hard you think about it
Only the timing will be delayed
I don't want to argue with what you think
Just follow your heart and move
There's a reason why
I'm a bit fussy

Your style catches my attention
Wherever you go, lead it, the atmosphere
So I want to have you
Now, ah, ah-ooh-woah-oh-oh-oh
I like the sudden curiosity that flowed over me
I don't want to regret as time passes
I'll give all my heart early
So even if I lose (So, yeah, baby)

I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Mm-ah)
I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Mm-ah)

Look at this, what I picked
Look at all the people in the world
But you know? You know?
I'm the one who can handle you
What else is a good sign?
Everything fits together
A spilling check
They're jealous, we fit well together

Maybe I'll find you, I don't know if I'm lost
Amongst these really vague feelings
True love, it's love
I definitely feel something (Oh, woah; So, yeah, baby)

I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Mm-ah)
I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Mm-ah)

I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Mm-ah)
I know what I want, I know what I want
I know what, what, what I want (Wish)
Getting what I want, getting what I want
Gonna get, get what I want (Wish)
