Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

From now on you're only mine, mine, mine, mine
Bragging you're officially mine, mine, mine, mine
How about If I really, really like
If you look at the outcomes, It's a miracle pitter-patter

It's one of the several billions
How can all of this can be explained?
So weird, so weird, so weird, so weird
Woah, woah, woah
So I am you?
No, so you're me too?
It's surreal, surreal
Is it real?

We're in love, love, love
I want the world to know that
I'm lucky, lucky, lucky
You're so lucky, lucky, lucky
Say it once more, more, more
I want to hear it again yoo-hoo-hoo
I like it, like it, like it
Yeah, I love it, love it, love it

Could it be that I used the greatest luck I had?
Because in this world
There's no such thing as a coincidence, right?
The luckiest one, the luckiest one
The luckiest one in the world
Shout it, shout it, shout it
We're so lucky, lucky, lucky

The corners of my eyes are endlessly down, down, down, down
The corners of the mouth goes up, high, high, high
Mystery, I can not explain it
Don't let anyone in here, keep this miracle a exit only

It's one of the several billions
How can all of this can be explained?
So weird, so weird, so weird, so weird
Woah, woah, woah
So I am you?
No, so you're me too?
It's surreal, surreal
Is it real?

We're in love, love, love
I want the world to know that
I'm lucky, lucky, lucky
You're so lucky, lucky, lucky
Say it once more, more, more
I want to hear it again yoo-hoo-hoo
I like it, like it, like it
Yeah, I love it, love it, love it

Could it be that I used the greatest luck I had?
Because in this world
There's no such thing as a coincidence, right?
The luckiest one, the luckiest one
The luckiest one in the world
Shout it, shout it, shout it
We're so lucky, lucky, lucky

An ordinary love stories
Can also be mysterious
From one to ten
The luck piles up
It's happening to me

We're in love, love, love
I want the world to know that
I'm lucky, lucky, lucky
You're so lucky, lucky, lucky
Say it once more, more, more
I want to hear it again yoo-hoo-hoo
I like it, like it, like it
Yeah, I love it, love it, love it

Could it be that I used the greatest luck I had?
Because in this world
There's no such thing as a coincidence, right?
The luckiest one, the luckiest one
The luckiest one in the world
Shout it, shout it, shout it
We're so lucky, lucky, lucky

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
