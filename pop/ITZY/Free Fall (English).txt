Like riding through the galaxy
Like a flash of light passing by
Jump into it, in your universe
Just my taste, free fallin'
On the illuminating heart sign, draw a parabola
We don't need to rush
Let's go on a trip, yeah, follow my lead, you ready?
(I-T-Z-Y, blow your mind, blow your mind)

The moment I took a step
An unfolding clear night sky
Like swimming across the galaxy
You know I'm ready to jump

We free fallin'
Up, down, I can fly, yeah
We free fallin'
Up in the air, I'm flying
A galaxy carpet under our feet
A cotton candy-like Milky Way
This feeling of love feels so high
We don't need too many words

We go jumpin'

Drop zone: two-one-two, hey, the landing is ready
Countdown, five, four, three, two, one, yeah, jump on
I'm shining brighter than a shooting star
Tok-tok, I'm aiming for your bouncing heart, bang
An illuminating full moon, don't know when it will burst
Glitter with love on all four sides, stars pouring out
Let's go on a trip, yeah, follow my lead, you ready?
(I-T-Z-Y, blow your mind, blow your mind)

The moment I took a step (This moment)
An unfolding clear night sky (Oh my gosh)
Like swimming across the galaxy
You know I'm ready to jump (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

We free fallin'
Up, down, I can fly, yeah
We free fallin'
Up in the air, I'm flying, yeah
A galaxy carpet under our feet
A cotton candy-like Milky Way
This feeling of love feels so high
We don't need too many words

Oh, lucky me, I met you
Lucky you, lucky you, you met me
Here we'll draw our rainbow
It will be sweet, this love, oh, yeah

We free fallin' (Free fallin')
Up, down, I can fly (I can fly, yeah, yeah)
We free fallin'
Up in the air, I'm flying (Air, I'm flying)
A galaxy carpet under our feet
A cotton candy-like Milky Way (Oh)
This feeling of love feels so high
We don't need too many words (We don't need it)

Ooh, free fallin' (Free fallin'; Free fallin')
Ooh, free fallin' (Yeah, ooh)
Ooh, free fallin' (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Free fallin'
