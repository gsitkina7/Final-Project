Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na

Love is like it's drawn on a filter
It's getting blurry, I can't judge everything
Keep on struggling, struggling even if you try
If you're being careless, mess up, yeah
Don't know why
It's not easy and feelings don't really last forever
Darling, haters will change again someday

I'm into you
Woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I'm getting closer
Woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I won't stop again
Someday love will break up, it blocks every time
I fall in love and turn away from you
Love is like a savage, don't crush your heart
I don't wanna mess up

Na-nah-yeah
Everybody's gonna love somebody (Yeah)
We exchange hearts easily with eagerness (Yeah)
Why is it still difficult for me?
I'm still stepping backwards
Na-nah-yeah
Everyday, I wanna love somebody (Yeah)
And it's okay to be a little bit selfish (Yeah)
I want to give you my heart
Without hesitation someday

I want to believe that it'll be different than ever
A true love that will erase even this scar (Yeah, uh)
You should be honest, It's not blurry
A bit more boldly (More boldly)
Such a clich√©, you wouldn't do that
Just convince me, I'll just wait

I'm into you
Woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I know why
Woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I hesitate again
Something's gonna happen, stay alert every time
If you already gave your heart, it will cool off
Love is like a savage, push it back
I don't wanna mess up

Na-nah-yeah
Everybody's gonna love somebody (Yeah)
We exchange hearts easily with eagerness (Yeah)
Why is it still difficult for me?
I'm still stepping backwards
Na-nah-yeah
Everyday, I wanna love somebody (Yeah)
And it's okay to be a little bit selfish (Yeah)
I want to give you my heart
Without hesitation someday

Hope it's different this time (Ayy, ayy)
I want to believe it, hope you're sincere (Hope you're)
Perhaps If not (I, uh-huh)
Without any regrets, please say "Bye, bye"

Na-nah-yeah
Everybody's gonna love somebody (Love somebody, yeah)
We exchange hearts easily with eagerness (Yeah)
Why is it still difficult for me?
I'm still stepping backwards
Na-nah-yeah
Everyday, I wanna love somebody
(Everyday, I wanna love somebody) (Yeah)
And it's okay to be a little bit selfish (Yeah)
I want to give you my heart
Without hesitation someday
