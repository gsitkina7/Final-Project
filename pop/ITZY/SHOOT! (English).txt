Check my look
My steps are like a dance
To look more powerful, I choose red shoes, yeah
No questions, what I look
Well, this is what I do
I approach you again and again
ITZY, ITZY, memorize the order, right now
Can you tell me your heart I don't even know
I don't even know, place an order

Mm, shoot my shoot
Like a butterfly, I burst in your heart
I don't like being obvious, see what I can do
I stand in front of you and hook my heart onto you
So, what you do?
Pop it, kaboom
Now tell me how you feel, ooh
Clear up your ambiguous mind, you
Sorry, I won't change, I'm not fool
That's what I do (That's what I do)

Look at my eyes (Yeah, yeah)
I can hear your heart beating
Boy, you gotta move
Make a dream, you and me are pretty cool (Pretty cool)
Everyone can see it (Everyone can see it)
There is only one way
In the end, there is only one way for you to go
Come quickly or just pass it by
Don't be silly baby, do not break my heart

Mm, shoot my shoot
Like a butterfly, I burst in your heart
I don't like being obvious, see what I can do
I stand in front of you and hook my heart onto you
So, what you do?
Pop it, kaboom
Now tell me how you feel, ooh
Clear up your ambiguous mind, you
Sorry, I won't change, I'm not fool
That's what I do (That's what I do)

La, la-la-la-la-la-la (La-la)
La-la-la (Yeah)
La, la-la-la-la-la-la, mm-mm
La-la-la-la-la-la
Mm, that's what I do
I know that's like a fool
But that's what I do
