Trust me with your heart
Trust me?

Flipping through my old diary
Bursting with dreams
That I once had in my heart
All of my dreams and my heart
For you are coming back out of blue
Tonight I just can't fall asleep
Remember how we used to be
So much to share but it's never easy
All my stories hidden deep inside me
Today I just wanna tell you
Whatever I've been holding back
MIDZY 넌 날 MIDZY (Trust me)
What a gift you give
The trust that you show me

It's you and I
Now is the moment for you and I
(Moment just for you and I)
More than anyone else tight
As the two can be
(No-one else)
MIDZY I know
Oh We trust one another
Always be by my side (Always)

Staying next to me, it's you
Believing in me, it's you
Don't worry about a thing
MIDZY I know
Oh We trust one another
Thank you for trusting in me

(I don't know how you get me every time)
Whenever I see you smiling at me
It just makes me smile like you
Oh I feel love
(Wishing you are feeling)
What I feel for you
Even when I'm acting
Like a child and be free
(Child and be free)
You take me just as who I truly am
Mistakes and all
Melting my heart
With your warming embrace
I can't ask for anything more
Nothing more (Nothing more)
MIDZY 넌 날 MIDZY (Trust me)
What a gift you give
The trust that you show me

It's you and I
Now is the moment for you and I
(Moment just for you and I)
More than anyone else tight
As the two can be
(No-one else)
MIDZY I know
Oh We trust one another
Thank you for trusting in me

Thank you's not enough
No, It's never enough
For someone who gave me
Their everything yeah
So hear now our song that I'm singing
Every word is meant to be only for you
(Words are meant to be only for you, oh baby)

It's you and I
Now is the moment for you and I
(Moment just for you and I)
More than anyone else tight
As the two can be
(No-one else)
MIDZY I know
Oh We trust one another
Always be by my side (Always)
Staying next to me, it's you
Believing in me, it's you
Don't worry about a thing
MIDZY I know
Oh We trust one another
Thank you for trusting in me
