I wake up in a good mood this morning
It's a day I've been looking forward for other days
It's glamorous from head to toe
Even if it's awkward, it's a different outfit (Oh, yeah, yeah)
My phone ring, ring
Find me all over the place
I'll leave quickly, so please wait for me
Mmm, excited than ever
I'm filled with a fuel of excitement

If you open the window once more, the wind blows
Where will you take us?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, let's go
All the things that you need, just talk

Take only the fun stuff, throw it all over there
A destination that's not on the map
Yeah, we chillin', chillin'
We be chillin', chillin' all day
Just take care of your expectations (Just take!)
Forget about everything yesterday (Forget!)
I'm going to a very far place
Yeah we chillin', chillin'
We be chillin', chillin' all day
I'm just chillin' with you

(Oh-oh) We chillin'
(Oh-oh) We're just chillin' now
(Oh-oh) We chillin'
Chillin', chillin' all day
We're just chillin' now

Yeah with you, just chillin' now, uh (Oh)

Fast passing by (Uh)
The scenery is our frame (Woo!)
The dark night sky (Everything)
I only see the shining stars
Under the clouds where we stayed
Drifting on the road gonna surfin'
When our eyes meet
A smile bursts out without hiding it
Mmm, like la-la-la, sing a song together
I'll reach the end of that sky

Stop here for a moment, perfect scenery
Now is the perfect time we've been dreaming of
Oh-oh-oh-oh, let's go
All the things that you need, just say

Take only the fun stuff, throw it all over there
A destination that's not on the map
Yeah, we chillin', chillin'
We be chillin', chillin' all day
Just take care of your expectations (Just take!)
Forget about everything yesterday (Forget!)
I'm going to a very far place
Yeah we chillin', chillin'
We be chillin', chillin' all day
I'm just chillin' with you

Tell me now, tell me what you wanna say (ITZY!)
So tell me now, tell me what you wanna say
As always, I can keep your secret
Can you show me your honest heart?

You can lean on me like that
I'll lend you my shoulder for your
Even those tears and little smiles
I'll understand everything
Even if you're out of words
I can tell it with your eyes
Always
Oh-oh-oh-oh, let's go
All the things that you need, just say it (Yeah)

Take only the fun stuff, throw it all over there
A destination that's not on the map
Yeah, we chillin', chillin'
We be chillin', chillin' all day
Just take care of your expectations (Just take!)
Forget about everything yesterday (Forget!)
I'm going to a very far place
Yeah we chillin', chillin'
We be chillin', chillin' all day
I'm just chillin' with you

(Oh-oh) We chillin'
(Oh-oh) We're just chillin' now
(Oh-oh) We chillin'
Chillin', chillin' all day
We're just chillin' now
