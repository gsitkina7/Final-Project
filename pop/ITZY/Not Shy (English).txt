Not shy, not me (ITZY)
I'm down so if you're down (Yeah)
Not shy, not me

Nobody-body ever got in the way
Of something I truly wanted
'Cause I don't waste time, I dive right in
Yeah I'mma take it, if I like it, if I like it, like it
Straight out the gate, no, I don't wanna wait
'Cause the word "hesitate" ain't a part of my game, yeah
Take a shot, take it pow-pow-pow-pow-pow
Not shy to say I want you
Hey there, hey there
We make a great pair, great pair
You know that if I could make you my own
I could show you things you never dreamed of
Yeah yeah, why don't you wake up? Follow the signs
You're a free agent, do what you like
But I'm impatient, swallow your pride
And let me know, let me know, 'cause I'm not shy

Not shy, not me (ITZY)
I'm down so if you're down (Not shy)
Not shy, not me
Tell me now if you're d-d-d-d-down
Not shy, not me (ITZY)
I'm down so if you're down (Not shy)
Not shy, not me
You're what I want, what I want, and I'm not shy

Nobody-body need to ask if you got it bad
'Cause I see right through you, ooh
You gotta keep your eyes on the prize
Yeah you will like it, 'cause you like it, 'cause you like it, like it
Gotta step up, boy, you're thinking too much
Forget everything else, 'cause I'm the only one, yeah
Clear your mind, clear it now-now-now-now-now
Not shy to say I want you
Hey there, hey there
We make a great pair, great pair
You know that if I could make you my own
I could show you things you never dreamed of
Yeah yeah, why don't you wake up? Follow the signs
You're a free agent, do what you like
But I'm impatient, swallow your pride
And let me know, let me know, 'cause I'm not shy

Not shy, not me (ITZY)
I'm down so if you're down (Not shy)
Not shy, not me
Tell me now if you're d-d-d-d-down
Not shy, not me (ITZY)
I'm down so if you're down (Not shy)
Not shy, not me
You're what I want, what I want, and I'm not shy

I don't wanna overthink it
Don't wanna have any regrets
Go, go, go, it's your turn tonight
No, yes, no, either way it's fine
Yeah, baby, no messing me around
All we can do is see how it plays out
Let's just be who we are
Do what we do, we go with the flow
Let the beat drop
Not shy, not me (ITZY)
I'm down so if you're down (Not shy)
Not shy, not me
So let me know, let me know, 'cause I'm not shy

Not shy, not me (ITZY)
I'm down so if you're down (Not shy)
