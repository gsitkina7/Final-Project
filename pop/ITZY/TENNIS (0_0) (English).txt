Yeah
Ah
Oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Yeah)
Yeah

A day with you is a match point
With this tension, I can't move my body
I'm hiding my heart from you, hi
I don't know if this continuing rally will ever end
Your gaze that I think of all day, what is this?
I don't know who will go first
One step is too short

A word to shake up your heart
I think I need it

The moment we meet is a good timing
I'm crossing the line, I'm yah-i-yah-i-yah
Shall I pitch it at this point?
I'm crossing the line, I'm yah-i-yah-i-yah, ah
Look, look
Here I go, smashing, smashing
Look, don't be surprised
That's right, yah-i-yah-i-yah, ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I didn't know, every day these days
I keep moving like a tiny ball
I don't know where it's gonna splash, but it's all fine (Fine)
Between us, who are divided by the net line
Eyes go back and forth, continuously tiki-taka (Oh)
Even if I pretend not to, I'll accept everything
Has it already begun?

The only word that will make waves in your heart (Uh huh, uh huh)
I'm trying to get it ready now

The moment we meet is a good timing
I'm crossing the line, I'm yah-i-yah-i-yah
Shall I pitch it at this point? (Uh, that's right)
I'm crossing the line, I'm yah-i-yah-i-yah, ah
Look, look
Here I go, smashing, smashing
Look, don't be surprised
That's right, yah-i-yah-i-yah, ah

This feeling makes me crazy
I don't know if I'm swinging for nothing (Probably not)
Let me finish this long, long game (Yeah)
I like being sure (Oh woah)
This feeling makes me crazy (Yeah)
My hands are shaking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Let me finish this long, long game
There's only one answer (Oh, woah, woah)

The moment we meet is a good timing
I'm crossing the line, I'm yah-i-yah-i-yah
Shall I pitch it at this point?
I'm crossing the line, I'm yah-i-yah-i-yah, ah
Look, look (Here I go, ooh, here I go)
Here I go, smashing, smashing (Oh, here I go)
Look, don't be surprised (Look, don't be surprised)
That's right, yah-i-yah-i-yah, ah

You
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Oh, woah, woah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ha, ha, ha, ha
