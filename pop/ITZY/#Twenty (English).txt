Ayy, woo
I am twenty
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Let me show ya what I wanna do
Twenty

I got this number
All of a sudden, the atmosphere has changed
Uh, the sight that treats me
It's just that the first digit has changed
Do it, do it
More, more, more
Twenty
Bucket list that I jotted down in class
Didn't know the end of the pages were blank
The fifth we're nearly hid the twelve o'clock
We've been waiting for it as soon as we like to party
This clear champagne that doesn't even taste good
I'm too innocent to know the depths
I don't want to fake and pretend to be an adult
I like the clumsy "me" of right now
Twenty

I can do anything
The moment I've been waiting for
My heart been beating so fast
Like the sound effect of twenty, twenty
Responsibilities are heavy
But freedom are sweet (Hey!)
I guess the world is mine
I am just twenty

Twenty, twenty, ooh, ooh
Twenty, twenty, ooh
Twenty, twenty, ooh, ooh
I am just twenty, twenty
Do or die, try everything
It's a possible age, twenty
Twenty twenty, ooh, ooh
I am just twenty, twenty

It's really interesting so, so
I just heard the love, love
Should I just closed my eyes?
I kinda hate that
I love myself
Love me, love me, nope!
Yeah, I'm just twenty
I have a big dreams
There's nothing to compromise, it's okay
I'm gonna make it
Hitting what I've become, all in
Experiences makes me grow
To level up, twenty

I can do anything
The moment I've been waiting for
My heart been beating so fast
Like the sound effect of twenty, twenty
Responsibilities are heavy
But freedom are sweet (Hey!)
I guess the world is mine
I am just twenty

Twenty, twenty, ooh, ooh
Twenty, twenty, ooh
Twenty, twenty, ooh, ooh
I am just twenty, twenty
Do or die, try everything
It's a possible age, twenty
Twenty twenty, ooh, ooh
I am just twenty, twenty

Didn't know that I'm brave
And being more outspoken
My dream doing it infinitely
Make something crazy, crazy
It's better to overflow this warm feeling
My youth, going higher
Make something crazy, crazy

I am just twenty

Twenty, twenty, ooh, ooh
Twenty, twenty, ooh
Twenty, twenty, ooh, ooh
I am just twenty, twenty
Wait a minute, I'm different
I'm old enough to do it, twenty
Twenty twenty, ooh, ooh
I am just twenty, twenty
