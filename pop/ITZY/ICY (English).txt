Hey, hey, hey, yo!
Woo! Beep beep!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I see that I'm icy
Go rising up, up
(I see that I'm icy)

Don't go mistaking me for cold, I tell it like it is
Couldn't care less what you think (Oh-oh oh-oh, come on!)
Forget it, just let it go (Here we go!)
Make way 'cause we're on a roll (On a roll)
Start up the soundtrack for me
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Icy but I'm on fire
I'm following my dream, I know what I want
Trust me, I'm not a liar
Don't bother trying to trap me inside your box
(Dance)

They go blah, blah
It don't matter, all you haters
Always blah, blah
They keep talkin', I keep walkin'
(They go blah, blah)
It don't matter, all you haters
(Always blah, blah)
They keep talkin', I keep walkin'

Ring, ring, ring, hear it all day long
They got my phone blowing up, yeah (Oh yeah)
I know this is your favourite song
That's how it's gonna end up, yeah (Up, yeah)
Hey, the ice is so thin
Don't be falling for me
Bling, bling, bling, shining like a star
Baby, that's me icy
Uh, shout out to my mama
And big ups to my papa
'Cause I got the best of both of ya
Ta-da-da-da-da-da
Forget it, just let it go (Here we go!)
Make way 'cause we're on a roll (On a roll)
Start up the soundtrack for me
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb

Icy but I'm on fire
I'm following my dream, I know what I want (Oh-oh-oh)
Trust me, I'm not a liar
Don't bother trying to trap me inside your box

They go blah, blah
It don't matter, all you haters
Always blah, blah
They keep talkin', I keep walkin'
(They go blah, blah)
It don't matter, all you haters
(Always blah, blah)
They keep talkin', I keep walkin'
Get it! Hey!
Shake it! Hey!
Yeah, come on!
Girls!

I'ma keep on running, don't care what they say
Keep on living for me, it's gon' be okay (Dan-dan-dan-dance)
Up, up, up, up, up we go
Ain't no looking down below
Climb 'till we can't climb no more

No one can stop us now, blah blah
It don't matter, all you haters
Always blah, blah
They keep talkin', I keep walkin'
(They go blah, blah)
It don't matter, all you haters
(Always blah, blah)
They keep talkin', I keep walkin'

Yeah
I see that I'm icy
I see that I'm icy
I see that I'm icy
I see that I'm icy
