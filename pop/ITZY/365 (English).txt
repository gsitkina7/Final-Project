Ee-yeah

Three, three-six-five, not thinking 'bout ya
Five, five to midnight, tick-tock, it's time
Look at the fall of the moon
Mark my words, I just roll
Trouble, trouble, you're the only case
Endurance, patience, he barely survived
Villain whose eyes opened in me, gonna find another one
Wow, wow, everyone was surprised to hear that

That's it
If you're obsessed, I'll scold you
365 days of opportunity
You dumped me, pathetic

Three, three-six-five, not thinking 'bout ya
Five, five to midnight, tick-tock, it's time
Clink, clink, there are more fun things
Old time, you stay here
Three-six-five, not thinking 'bout ya
Why don't you know that yet?
Don't know
Alone

That's right, what now? I don't even care
I'm free beyond the parallel universe
I'm relaxing on your head
Feeling myself, 'cause I don't want ya
All my ladies, my friends are so reliable
If you can't read the mood, it's not fun
Villain whose eyes opened in me, gonna find another one
Wow, wow, everyone was surprised to hear that

You don't know
Our castle built up
The short and long time
It could have sparkled

Three, three-six-five, not thinking 'bout ya
Five, five to midnight, tick-tock, it's time
Clink, clink, there are more fun things
Old time, you stay here
Three-six-five, not thinking 'bout ya
Why don't you know that yet?
Why are you the only one in the world?
I don't know what everyone knows

To me in another dimension (Ayy-oh)
Find him, get him out (Ayy-oh)
I don't want to stay the same

Way-oh, way-oh
I'm much better, babe
Way-oh, way-oh
What do you want to do?
Way-oh, way-oh
You can talk 'cause I don't care
Way-oh, way-oh
'Cause I don't care

Three, three-six-five, not thinking 'bout ya
Five, five to midnight, tick-tock, it's time
Why don't you know that yet?
Three, three-six-five, not thinking 'bout ya
