Ayy-yeah-yeah-yeah
La-la, la-la-la-la
Ayy-yeah-yeah-yeah

You wanted casting, but I'm sorry
I'll have to decline politely
You weren't like this at first, you're getting more and more disruptive
In this little phone, you've locked me up (Lock up)
How I dress and how I talk is like what now?
I don't understand your type and style at all
Ring, ring, where are you doing what baby? (What?)
Ping, ping, the smackdown begins

You're pushing me but I don't care
So baby no, no, no, don't call me no more
I don't need it, you're calling me right now
You make me crazy, stop right there

Sorry, next
Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe
I'm sorry next
Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe
Sorry but next
Get out from the front seat (Baby, hurry)
I refuse your cherry picking (Cherry picking)
Don't try to change me, honey
Swipe, swipe, swipe
Yeah, to the next

Ayy-yeah-yeah-yeah
Sorry, next
Ayy-yeah-yeah-yeah

Why are there so many things that you can do but I can't?
The delusion you have that I can't be without you
It's vibrating all day, your vibe that shakes me (Vibe)
Please stop it, please don't kill my vibe
My best friend is like what now?
What am I supposed to do if she's being cold?
Ring, ring, who are you meeting again baby?
Tick-tick, I erased your message

I'll be absent, so please give up, babe
Oh, baby no, no, no, don't call me no more
I don't need it, I'll turn you off for a while
You make me crazy, stop right there

Sorry, next
Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe
I'm sorry next
Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe
Sorry but next
Get out from the front seat (Baby, hurry)
I refuse your cherry picking (Cherry picking)
Don't try to change me, honey
Swipe, swipe, swipe
Yeah, to the next

From my side to the end, real quick
Ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
Thoroughly from inside out
Ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
Back off, real talk, go farther
Ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
Get out of my phone, baby

Sorry, next
Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe

Sit down, this is your seat (Baby, sit down)
Our relationship ends here (Flush it down)
Don't try to change me, honey
