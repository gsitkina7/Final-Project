Leggo, just let me be
I’m a devil rather than an innocent angel
Look at me, look at me properly
The kid who doesn't listen, that’s me

They say they’re saying it all for my own sake
But even I don’t really know myself
Don’t try to fit me in your mold
I’m going to play the way I want now

Are you surprised? It’s like bubblegum pop
Because I broke all the rules
Because I’m going to show you the real me
Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah

I’m going to do the things I want
You can sit there and watch

Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top
Get rid of everything that is obvious
My dream is bigger than you think
Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah

Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah

They keep telling me to become
Someone, a shining someone
But who is that?
Here I’m one and only
I’m me, that’s what makes me special
I’m so tired of the same things
I want to find something entirely new
You know that’s my charm
Who would do things like this if not me?

Are you surprised? It’s like bubblegum pop
Because I broke all the rules
Because I’m going to show you the real me
Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah

I’ll give you something that’s beyond your imagination
All you have to do is follow me

Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top
Get rid of everything that is obvious
My dream is bigger than you think
Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah

Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah

I want to be me, the answer is simple
I’m following my heart now

Are you surprised? It’s like bubblegum pop
Because I broke all the rules
Because I’m going to show you the real me
Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah

Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah
Really, really me
I’m a cherry on top, yeah
