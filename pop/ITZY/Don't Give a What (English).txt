Don't give a what
I-I-I don't give a what
Don't give a what

What the hell is so complicated?
I have a headache
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)
I was just born this way
Sorry, but we ain't sorry
You're in a pair of colored glasses
Don't try to lock us up
No more hiding, you are you
Singin' like pow, pow, pow!

I don't care if everyone says it's wrong
We're all right
Starting with your own way
Even your own color
Show me everything, whatever it's fine
You know that I don't give a

Uh, what, whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm going to show you
What? Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whatever with confidence
Follow me and shout out to the world
Hey! No one can stop us
I don't give a what

La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la
Don't give a what
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
I don't give a what
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la
(Don't give a what)
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
I don't give a what

Set myself free (Free)
Prejudice break (Break)
Regardless I lo-lo-love me
I'm not a criminal whatever it is (Woo)
I'm gonna break everything
Don't try to fit yourself in the same mold
Never lose, you are you
Singin' like pow, pow, pow!

I don't care if everyone says it's wrong
We're all right
Starting with your own way
Even your own color
Show me everything, whatever it's fine
You know that I don't give a

You know that I don't give a
Uh, what, whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm going to show you
What? Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whatever with confidence
Follow me and shout out to the world
Hey! No one can stop us
I don't give a what

Yeah, no matter what they say
No more fear
Strike, strike a pose, strike, strike a pose
Oh whoa, ah ah
Strike, strike a pose, strike, strike a pose
No drama-ma-ma
If you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Come put your hands up (Hands up!)
If you feel me and know it's love
Come put your hands up (Hands up! Oh woah)

I'm gonna show you now, like this

You know that I don't give a
Uh, what, whoa-whoa-whoa (Oh whoa)
I'm going to show you (Hoo!)
What? Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whatever with confidence
Follow me and shout out to the world
Hey! No one can stop us
I don't give a what

La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la
Don't give a what
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
I don't give a what
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la
Don't give a what
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
I don't give a what
