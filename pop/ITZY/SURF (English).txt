Ooh, ooh, ooh, surf
Surf, surf

You know? I’m actually quite snobby
Oh, so I tried to be more cold towards you
But I can’t hide
I can’t control my feeling
As if I’ve fallen in the sea
The feeling keeps swaying

This is not quite like myself
It feels like I’m having seasick
When you smile with your eyes
I control my pace
But soon waver
When you get suddenly close
My breath hitches

Below my feet, my heart sways, yeah

My feelings move up & down, it rides on the wave every time
My heart beats faster and faster
When I see you
Up & down, keeps lifting me up and down
I really don’t want to admit it
But seems like I’ve fallen for you, I’m done for

Surf surf, every day move up
Surf surf, for the whole day, I
Surf surf, again move down
My heart faster and faster
Falls for you

Ah yeah
What push and pull, how laughable
Ride on water, uncertain
From the left to the right, trying to feel me out
Makes me dizzy, ooh, that’s enough
Keep the poker face
My heart, please calm down now
The danger level is risky
It might really overflow at this rate

I told myself to be cool about it
But I end up getting swept by it
When you look at me
When you look at me

The balance I barely maintained starts to shake

My feelings move up and down, it rides on the wave every time
My heart beats faster and faster
When I see you
Up and down, keeps lifting me up and down
I really don’t want to admit it
But seems like I’ve fallen for you, I’m done for

Oh, Typical romance is boring
I don’t like typical things
That’s what I thought
But you’re somehow different
I don’t dislike it if it’s you
Right, right, right, right, right oh!

My feelings move up and down, it rides on the wave every time
My heart beats faster and faster
When I see you
Up and down, keeps lifting me up and down
It’s obvious that I’m falling for you
So I won’t worry anymore, I’ll go to you

Surf surf, every day move up
Surf surf, for the whole day, I
Surf surf, again move down
My heart faster and faster
Falls for you
