Ah, ah
I'll light up my heart

To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror
I'll whisper a little, little, little
To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror
Ah

Dream is a far distant maze
I've lost my path above the star-ar-ar-ars
Being tired of the past
Shining on the day I was crying, shine, we are, are, are, are

It was a pity that my height was a bit short
Hope will soon grow taller

I know the words I need to hear every day
Words that will lift me up with my only own "Me"
That's enough now I-
I know, when my heart shines
I will now smile broadly
I'm shining in the mirror
Whispering every day that you will be okay

To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror
I'll whisper a little, little, little
To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror
We will be okay

Trust sometimes comes with a cold rain
Floating while soaked wet clou-ou-oud
I'm strong, my happy face, the eyes hidden on it
It's crystal clear, every day high high-igh-igh

Hope that the sunlight will shine sweetly
When the morning gush over

I know the words I need to hear every day
Words that will lift me up with my only own "Me"
That's enough now I-
I know, when my heart shines
I will now smile broadly
I'm shining in the mirror
Whispering every day that you will be okay

To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror (Oh woah)
I'll whisper a little, little, little (Oh woah)
To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror
We will be okay (We will be okay)
Mirror, mirror, mirror in my own way (Way)
Mirror, mirror, mirror in my own way (Way)
Mirror, mirror, mirror in my own way
We will be okay

The white moonlight that leads me behind the clear mirror
Like a sweet dream with a new meaning, change me
Ah

I dream that my heart grows deeper every day
Every dazzling nights (Dazzling nights)
The world beyond the mirror (The world beyond)
That reflects me (I'm a mirror)
I dreamed when I gently open my eyes (When I open)
An unfolding rainbow (Rainbow)
A mirror that illuminates my heart (Ooh)
Cast a spell then I will be okay (Be okay, yeah)

To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror (Yeah)
I'll whisper a little, little, little (Ooh)
To you in the mirror, mirror, mirror
We will be okay
Mirror, mirror, mirror in my own way
Mirror, mirror, mirror in my own way (My own way)
Mirror, mirror, mirror in my own way
I'll shine on never changing me

And we will be okay
I'll always shine
