It's the wild, wild west
Let's go
It's the wild, wild west

Be careful to not get stabbed
There are a lot of thorns on the outside (No, no, no)
Even if I'm not considerate, I'm not being rude
That's my attitude, oh-oh-oh
Even with the thorns sprouting
If you like me, I don't care (Oh)
I don't hide my temper from the outside
But it hints at beauty on the inside

Please don't come too close
It will hurt if you get stabbed
I don't want to hurt you
Uh yeah, you know we are young blood
I won't give in with this sand breeze, I won't give up

It's the wild, wild west
A slightly rough type (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't even know how to speak in a pretty way
But, why do you like me?
It's the wild, wild west
A slightly rough type (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sometimes I shoot at you with words
Bang, bang, bang
It's the wild, wild west

Meeny, meeny, meeny
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
It's the wild, wild west
You better be mine

I'm the flower that colors you
I hurt deeply so it doesn't heal
Don't be scared, I'm just a wild flower
Seep, seep, seep into it, keep going
I don't wither, I don't need any petals
When we look at each other from afar, sometimes we are closer
Like a sip of water in Oasis
I look for you when I'm desperate, oh, do I need you?

Please don't come too close
It will hurt if you get stabbed
I don't want to hurt you
Uh yeah, you know we are young blood
I won't give in with this sand breeze, I won't give up

It's the wild, wild west
A slightly rough type (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't even know how to speak in a pretty way
But, why do you like me?
It's the wild, wild west
A slightly rough type (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sometimes I shoot at you with words
Bang, bang, bang
It's the wild, wild west

When I stab you with my thorny words
You look at me and laugh without knowing that you're hurt
I just wanna more, I wanna more and more
Another quaking heart, a melting vibe
You won't know me till the end

It's the wild, wild west
A slightly rough type (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't even know how to speak in a pretty way
But, why do you like me?
It's the wild, wild west
A slightly rough type (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sometimes I shoot at you with words
Bang, bang, bang
It's the wild, wild west

Meeny, meeny, meeny
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (Sing it, yeah, yeah!)
It's the wild, wild west (It's the wild, wild west)
You better be mine (Anything, girls?)

That's right, yeah
No, woah-woah
It's it's the wild, wild west
