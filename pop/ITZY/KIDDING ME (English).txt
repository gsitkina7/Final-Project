I'm bored of your obvious excuses, yeah (Blah blah)
Your clumsy expression is a little, trouble baby (You're such no fun)
If you got me on your mind, don't look so obvious
Spending a meaningless time bothers me
(Everyday, I'm sick and tired)

I, I, I don't want to wait, yeah
I'll be losing on my mind, mind, mind, yeah
You don't know what is matter?
An error that keeps repeating
Ta-ta-ta, ayy
Right before it bursts, we blow up

Even today you're nah, nah
Even tomorrow you'll be nah, nah
Do something different on the outside, baby
Even today I am like nah, nah
Even tomorrow I'll be nah, nah
You're hurting me every day, all day
I keep asking, hey stop, hey stop
But you ignore me again, don't stop, don't stop
This is too much, be prudent now
Don't say it's a joke anymore

Do it right, stop kidding me now
Kidding me, kidding me, yeah, yeah
Do it right, stop kidding me
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You can't commit
Do it right, stop kidding me now

My anger is racks on racks
It's been filled up, stacks up yeah
Your uncomfortable words tighten me up so tight
You cannot over-control me
I'm already on top of your head
Even if you run, you'll eventually stay in the same place
Yeah, now it's time over
I don't care anymore

I, I, I don't want to understand you, yeah
I'll be losing on my mind, mind, mind, yeah
I know, what is matter?
An error that can't be solved in the end
Ta-ta-ta, ayy
I'm fueling the fire, shoot it up

Even today you're nah, nah
Even tomorrow you'll be nah, nah
Do something different on the outside, baby
Even today I am like nah, nah
Even tomorrow I'll be nah, nah
You're hurting me every day, all day
I keep asking, hey stop, hey stop
But you ignore me again, don't stop, don't stop
This is too much, be prudent now
Don't say it's a joke anymore

Do it right, stop kidding me now
Kidding me, kidding me, yeah, yeah
Do it right, stop kidding me
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You can't commit
Do it right, stop kidding me now

Now your sincere words are mixed
Can you look in my eyes and tell me
Stop thinking about the truth, tell me now, baby
Give it to me straight

Do it right, stop kidding me now
Kidding me, kidding me, yeah, yeah
Do it right, stop kidding me
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You can't commit
Do it right, stop kidding me now

This love is savage, yah-yah-yah, yeah
Dizzy and nervous, yah-yah-yah, yeah
This love is savage, yah-yah-yah, yeah
Dizzy and nervous
Do it right, stop kidding me now
