Thinkin' about ya, city centre
A building that doesn't sleep, a forest firefly
Thinkin' about ya, my hand in a fist
And face about to cry, yeah, a night I suffered alone
(Ah-hah) Behind the bright city, a shadow
(Ah-hah) This fierce jungle feardom
Thinkin' about us, city centre
A building that doesn't sleep, a forest firefly

(Ooh) You are here
(Ooh) Here by my side
(Ooh) I won't cry
Hold me tight, hold me tight
If I tell you honestly, oh

You know I'm holding up when I see you
Like a domino, domino
You can't just collapse
Like a domino, domino
(Hey) You and I got the same feeling
You and I, we ain't falling
(Hey) We'll be each other's strength and withstand it
Like a domino, domino

One, two, in the worn-out building lights, yeah
The light of the fire that doesn't go out, it's in my head, yeah
Talkin' about ya, talkin' about us
Look at you, who resembles a different me

(Ooh) You are here
(Ooh) Here by my side
(Ooh) I already know
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Even if I don't say it, oh

You know I'm holding up when I see you
Like a domino, domino
You can't just collapse
Like a domino, domino
(Hey) You and I got the same feeling
You and I, we ain't falling
(Hey) We'll be each other's strength and withstand it
Like a domino, domino

We ain't falling like a domino
Hold me, you're doing well
We ain't falling like a domino
Hold me, please trust me

You know I'm holding up when I see you
Like a domino, domino
You can't just collapse
Like a domino, domino
(Hey) You and I got the same feeling
You and I, we ain't falling
(Hey) We'll be each other's strength and withstand it
Like a domino, domino

We ain't falling like a domino
Hold me, you're doing well
We ain't falling like a domino
Like a domino, domino
