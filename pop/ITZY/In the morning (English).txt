Shh...

Guess who loves you, yeah, that's right
Do I show you, no, not I
Where's the mystery? It's not time
Get you close, I get you close
Then bam, in the dead of the night!

I'mma steal your heart away, you are gonna love me
You won't even know what hit ya 'til I'm baring my teeth
'Cause I'm so good at playing the role
I won't be the first one to fold
If loving you makes me a felon, who done it, who? You'll never know
Am I getting you, getting you just a little confused?
You know I never could, never could stick to all of the rules
Well it's finally, finally time to make up your mind
Hope you're ready, who knows what could happen in the night?

I'm the mafia
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mafia, yah
We do it like a mafia
Ring-ding-ding, ding-ding-ding
I'm the mafia
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mafia, yah
We do it like a mafia
Watch your back until the break of day

Target in the night, you don't even know (Ayy)
Hit you like the mafia (Ayy)
In the morning light, you don't even know (Ayy)
Hit you like the mafia

Oscar worthy, got you fooled
Playing innocent but I'm a wolf (No)
You don't have the faintest clue (Ah-hah)
I been planning for a while, baby all systems are go (Brrrah!)
Better watch your, watch your heart 'cause you're no match for me
I'm a break in, break in, break in like a caper movie, ready?
Can you read my poker face? (Ah)
Hit me, I'm raising the stakes (Ah)
Hurry up! Baby, catch me if you can, haha!

Am I getting you, getting you just a little confused?
You know I never could, never could stick to all of the rules
Well it's finally, finally time to make up your mind
Hope you're ready, who knows what could happen in the night?

I'm the mafia
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mafia, yah
We do it like a mafia
Ring-ding-ding, ding-ding-ding
I'm the mafia
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mafia, yah
We do it like a mafia
Hit you like the mafia

You know in the morning, I'm the last one standing, yeah, yeah
Ma: My lil' game
Fi:  finishes tonight

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
