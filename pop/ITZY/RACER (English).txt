I'm a racer
Alright
I'm a racer

In any case, now or never
Don't worry, no more problem
Speed up 'til the maximum
We on it, on the winner podium (Yo, yo)
My heart is pounding hard like rum-pum-pum-pum
Tension going up, no limit, more, more
Shift up, go quick
Basic instinct, no one can stop us

Trailblazing the race
We're acing this game
On the track, the main characters are us
Now, we'll be all the rage
Run, run more without hesitation
Champ, that's our title, title
Until the end, we run out of breath
Now it's the final lap
Hit it, hit it, breaking records, done

I'm a racer
I'm a racer
Vroom-vroom, we're so fast
Focus and we're gone
Ride, get on if you wanna win it
Let's be born ready, number ones
I'm a racer
Vroom-vroom, we're so fast
They can't chase after us (Come follow me)

Put your head up and listen, nothing's too late
I'll show you clearly, all in 8K
Baby, we're so rare, can't shut out like a monster
We gon' be a rock star
My heart is pounding hard like rum-pum-pum-pum
Rely on each other, eventually all thumbs up
Trust me, now you can
Hit the pedal, bam, oh

If you're all in with me
We're all chosen ones
We're 'bout to flip this world, you'll see
Yeah, yeah
