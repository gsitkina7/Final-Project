Loco

Walked in, smooth operator hit your mark
I'm gettin' loco, loco
Oh gosh, pure shot of poison to my heart
I'm gettin' loco, loco
I'm trapped and there's no way out
Surrounded by my thoughts of ya
I think I'm a little obsessed
I feel like I was born to love ya
SOS for this kitty
Fresh like rain when I'm thirsty
Gon' lock you down I got my eye on you, yellow
Feeling the fuego tonight, come and fan the flame
It's too late, want you so bad
I decided not to fight it
Can't contain it anyway
'Cause you got me blinded

Such a rush, you're making me lose my mind
You got me like cray-cray-crazy in love
What you doing to me?
Can't get off this bad roller coaster ride
You got me like cray-cray-crazy in love
I'm addicted, outta control

I'm gettin' loco, loco
I'm gettin' loco, loco

So tell me what's your intention
I'm tripping when I know you playing with my emotions
I keep on going back and forth, it's hell then heaven
Pushing me right to the edge of broken
So dangerous
So, so, so dangerous, uh-oh
Ain't the type to risk it all
But you got me acting irrational
Oasis for this kitty
So stay, I need you next to me
Break down my defenses
I don't wanna fight it

Such a rush, you're making me lose my mind
You got me like cray-cray-crazy in love
What you doing to me?
Can't get off this bad roller coaster ride
You got me like cray-cray-crazy in love
I'm addicted, outta control

Loco
I'm gettin' loco, loco-co
I'm gettin' loco, loco-co, oh-oh-oh
I'm gettin' loco, loco-co
I'm gettin' loco, loco-co, oh-oh-oh

Love that rush, you're making me lose my mind
You got me like cray-cray-crazy in love
What you doing to me?
Can't get off this bad roller coaster ride
You got me like cray-cray-crazy in love
I'm addicted, outta control
I'm gettin' loco, loco
I'm gettin' loco, loco
