Weapon, weapon, weapon
Oh-oh-oh

Never question it, got no doubts
I never have regrets, it's my time-ime
Pour it all out, shout it out
Bomb, bomb, blow it up 'bout to turn it up
Raise your voice get louder now shout, shout
I'm 'bout to show this stage above killer, killer
I always stay strong
So bring it all down
I want a higher place I desire-sire

Wait, aim for the gap
I'm ruling this game
Blade, set the day, slice it all
I'm carving my name
Ignited dynamite, throw it high
Begin the countdown
Take it out with confidence
No-oh-oh

Weapon, weapon, weapon
Oh-oh-oh, aim it to the world (Weapon)
Hold your gaze, your eyes are a razor
Pull it all, no you can't touch me
Oh-oh-oh, aim it to the world

Ayy, one shot, deep fatal strike
Ayy, one kill, surrender, I don't let it pass
Shoot it up, spit, I go "shung" like a queen bee
Aim at the target ta-da-da-da, bang-bang
Woah-oh-oh, hot
Feed the flame more
Pouring down, milli billi missile raining
Can't avoid it, there's no warning, warning

Wait, aim for the gap
I'm ruling this game
Blade, set the day, slice it all
I'm carving my name
Ignited dynamite, throw it high
Begin the countdown
Take it out with confidence, no

Weapon, weapon, weapon
Oh-oh-oh, aim it to the world (Weapon)
Hold your gaze, your eyes are a razor
Pull it all, no, you can't touch me
Oh-oh-oh, aim it to the world

Control this ground
Get ready and now open your eyes
Set this on fire

Don't be surprised, don't be surprised
You changed, changed
Now that you, now that you know
Hey listen, my weapon is different (Oh-oh-oh)
Turn it all over, this is my vision
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised
You changed, changed
Now that you, now that you know
Hey listen my weapon is different (Oh-oh-oh)
Turn it all over, this is my vision
Pouring down milli billi missile raining

Weapon, weapon, weapon (Yeah, huh)
Oh-oh-oh, aim it to the world (Weapon)
Hold your gaze, your eyes are a razor
Pull it all, no you can't touch me
Oh-oh-oh, aim it to the world

Don't be surprised, don't be surprised
You changed, changed
Now that you, now that you know
