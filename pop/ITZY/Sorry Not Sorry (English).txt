Sorry, not sorry, I'm sorry I'm not sorry
How come I get sick even if I stay still?
I'm greedy because I don't know how to copy them
I don't want to be boring, different every time

(Ah) I still have a lot to show you
(Ah) Just trust me and follow me (Alright)
So lift your head high, like that
Blow your mind, blow, blow your mind

Do you want to see it? (Are you ready for me?)
What do you want? (Are you ready for me?)
Can you feel me? (Can you feel me now?)
Don't hesitate to copy me, oh

Make it, make it hot
Copy me, da-da-da-da
Fly up without hesitation
Make it high, more, more, more, more
I-T-Z-Y, listen up now
Everyone shout at us, higher, higher
Sorry I never stop
I don't know how to stop
Sorry, I'ma make it all mine
I want to have it all, all, all, all
I-T-Z-Y, listen up now
Look at us and go crazy, higher, higher

Look at me, I have a unique vibe
I have a natural style, I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, go up high
Ah-ah-ah-ah, we go up high

(Ah) Day and night are too short for me
(Ah) My day is different every moment (Alright)
Lift your head high, like that
Blow your mind, blow, blow your mind

Do you want to see it? (Are you ready for me?)
What do you want? (Are you ready for me?)
Can you feel me? (Can you feel me now?)
Don't hesitate to copy me, oh

Make it, make it hot
Copy me, da-da-da-da
Fly up without hesitation
Make it high, more, more, more, more
I-T-Z-Y, listen up now
Everyone shout at us, higher, higher
Sorry I never stop
I don't know how to stop
Sorry, I'ma make it all mine
I want to have it all, all, all, all
I-T-Z-Y, listen up now
Look at us and go crazy, higher, higher

I wanna make it, ITZY no limit
Nobody, nobody, nobody stop me
I wanna make it, ITZY no limit
Nobody, nobody, nobody stop me
I wanna make it, ITZY no limit
Nobody, nobody, nobody stop me
Nobody, nobody, nobody stop me
I'm gonna make it, gonna make it
Can't stop me, oh

Sorry not sorry, I'm sorry I'm not sorry
When I hear the sound of envy it hurts my ears
I never do anything boring no matter what people say
Go higher up there, go up very high

Make it, make it hot
Copy me, da-da-da-da
Fly up without hesitation
Make it high, more, more, more, more
I-T-Z-Y, listen up now
Everyone shout at us higher, higher

Look at us and go crazy, we go up higher
