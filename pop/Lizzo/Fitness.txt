Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

I've been lifting heavy metal
See this ass? Ain't no rental
Take it down low like just stretching
Pick it back up like I'm flexing
Woo, tryna get it, working on my fitness
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I got that ass that don't stop
That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off

Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

Toot toot, beep beep
Toot toot, beep beep
I been working, working on my fitness

Ooh, work my body like
Ooh, I know you want it like
Ooh, but I don't do this for you

Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I got that ass that don't stop
That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off
But I don't do this for you
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business (Better mind yo business)
I been working, working on my fitness (I'm working on my fitness)
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness
