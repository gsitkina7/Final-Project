Have you ever been to Paris at night?
Say something French
On va voir Lionel Richie au Zénith ensemble ça va être cool

Right out the gate, I'm flowin' individually
You owe me your check
Respecting a pony, I swear to God like a helmet
Free as I move booze
I'm paid to amuse you's
Amazed at how soon we could get this far
Broke off of mix tapes
Still broke off that mix tape
But I promise y'all that it won't last as long
'Cause me and my girls, delinquents
We renting jewels and the trinkets
Trumps bumping something fan fare when we arrive like
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor

I feel like any minute decision
With precision, I pick off
Make my selection on who I choose to crew with
Girl, don't touch us
I know you want us to slip but
Slippin' is something we don't do
Tippin' for life, grippin' that ice
You thirsty to wife, uh
We playing y'all home like bassoons
We going straight up like balloons
We fresh outta that saloon
We steady making y'all goals droop
With that vidal, with that sasoon
You been lost, where you been at?
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
(Oh my gosh)
(Don't bother me
Don't bother me)

I beg you, don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
He drops it on the floor
My side dude complains and keeps it on the low
He touch himself to magazines
To pictures of his own
D-d-don't bother me, bother me
D-d-don't bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Ego
Been showing lovers their own selves
Covered in 
Pride
Without natural affection
Truth ablaze
Where you been at?
Where you been at?
Bother me, bother me, bother me
I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
It got me thinkin' about thinking of you
I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
And you know I, know I, know I loved you
Think 'bout you
But I don't got time for livin' side the comforts
Of my God damn time so I leave it up to me
You been sendin' all these broken signals
I just keep him asking what we could have done
You tell me that I am too ambitious
But I break the moulds and you just watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
You watch my stone roll away from you
It didn't even take three days
Didn't even take me there
Didn't even take me there
