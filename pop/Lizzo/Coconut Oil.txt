I remember back, back in school when I wasn't cool
Shit, I still ain't cool, but you better make some room for me
I'm comin' through with my crew at the rendezvous
Yeah, it's a party over here now, yeah, it's a party over here now

If I knew then what I know now
I'd give myself a souvenir for old times' sake
'Cause I got all that I need here and I'm good, yeah, yeah
I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love
But all I needed was some coconut oil
Don't worry 'bout the small things, I know I can do all things
Mama always told me it would be alright
I thought I needed the rush, but there was never enough
'Cause all I needed was some coconut oil
Don't worry 'bout the small things, I know I can do all things
Mama always told me that and she was right (Ba-ba-ba-ba)

It's a party over here now
It's a party over here now, yeah
It's a party over here now
It's a party over here now (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
It's a party over here now
It's a party over here now, yeah
It's a party over here now
It's a party over here now (Ba-ba-ba-ba)

When I look at you, I see me, so I do unto
You as I would do someone livin' in my two story
We got different stories, we under one roof
So when it spring a leak, we both got work to do
If I knew then what I know now
I'd give myself a souvenir for old times' sake
'Cause I got all that I need here and I'm good, yeah, yeah

I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love
But all I needed was some coconut oil
Don't worry 'bout the small things, I know I can do all things
Mama always told me it would be alright
I thought I needed the rush, but there was never enough
'Cause all I needed was some coconut oil
Don't worry 'bout the small things, I know I can do all things
Mama always told me that and she was right (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
