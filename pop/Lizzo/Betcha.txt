My ni-hick-a, momma hiccup
Got to pick up the whole damn check plus the tip 'cause
Bosses right off they dinner
You lookin like, I say what I am the breadwinner
You a crip bruh, just the tip, cuz
Got to go how you say 'bouts the dim sum
Heavy setter (boss), jet-setter (floss)
Oh you too hotel me but
You ain't in the Best Western
Balls to wall in your courtroom
Objectify and undress you
'Til you the last one in the darkroom
Exposure bitch, don't get sued
Big business say forever, that's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me even 
And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you had glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup
Looking like Stevie

Yup, 'bout to post my list on the wall
Of the school auditroium
Tacked up neatly
Sheets upon sheets upon sheets
For weeks upon weeks upon weeks
That these people cold feet
I've got a tissue for you boo-hoos
Hip-hop guys 'round singing the blues
I ain't talking bout the rapper
I'm talking bout the gift beneath the wrappers
Called a happily ever after
Fact is, it ain't too late
You still been making them hits
Since the seventh grade
Big business, say forever
That's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me
And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you have glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup
Looking like Stevie
