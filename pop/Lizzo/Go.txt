Wake up in the morning and stop
Feeling like the world’s going to drop
If I don’t do nothing, I’m going to pop
Now I’m hotter than a boiling pot
If you super tight, people flip
If you fall off, you’re a flop
Never thought nothing, would be better than something
That’s why I stay watering my crops

I’m not thirsty baby, I’m just lonely
And I’m not distant baby, I’m just busy
Will you miss me baby, when I’m touring
Or will you find someone that’s less important
But worth exploring, I’m torn in pieces
So much to do, hold on got to write in these features
I’m listening, but not really
You know us artist types
When we got to go, you got to let us

Go (gotta let us)- repeat

It’s cold outside
And I was thinking
And I was thinking
How warm it is
In the cloud (posturepedic)
But all that is, is vapor, condensation, conversation
Not really, but Jack Daniel's is the life of the party
Get it started, let him do the talking
Let that man speak
This girl is going to break your heart
Run far away this is your head start
Everything is not what it seems
The girl of your dreams is a nightmare
You don’t care
Man, that Jack Daniel's be lying on me
Cause of that dude now you laying on me
Flame is rekindled now I’m trying homie
Don’t leave me dry when I’m high homie
You don’t how it feels to appear the weakling of your peers from a fear
That’s inconceivable to have yourself and to suddenly to let it
Go (gotta let us)
