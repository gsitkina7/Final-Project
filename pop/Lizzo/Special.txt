(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
Special (Ooh)

Woke up this mornin' to somebody in a video
Talkin' about somethin' I posted in a video
If it wasn't me, then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm black and heavy? Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been drivin' slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new, but I've been used to people judgin' me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me
I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect

Special (Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)

Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fuckin' stones if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so much shame, hm

I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know (Oh)
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (Perfect)

(Ooh) I know that I'm not alone, oh, so
(Ooh) I thought that I'd let you know
Uh, yeah, yeah (No, oh, woo)

In case nobody told you today
You're special (Yeah)
In case nobody made you believe (Oh-oh)
You're special (Yeah)
Well, I will always love you the same (Love you)
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (I'm so glad, so glad, so glad)
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (I'm so glad, so glad, so glad)

Special
You are, you are, you are so
Special
Mm-mm, hey
