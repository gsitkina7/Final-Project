(Girls) Bitches, uh
Bitches, uh, uh-huh

Hold my bag, bitch, hold my bag
Do you see this shit? Hold me back
I'm about to knock somebody out, yo, where my best friend?
She the only one I know to talk me off the deep end

'Cause that's my girl, we codependent
If she with it, then I'm with it
Yeah, we tussle, mind your business
So, so, so, so, so slew
That's my girl, we CEOs
And dancin' like a C-E-ho
We about to throw them bows
Let's fuck it up
Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
Yeah, this the type of fight I'm lookin' for
Whеre my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)

Lеt me take these earrings off and hit the boosie ratchet with my friends
Woah-oh, woah-oh (Whoop that ho)
I'ma go Lorena Bobbitt on him, so he never fuck again
(No-oh) Nah, you can't fuck again, bro

That's my girl, we codependent
If she with it, then I'm with it
Yeah, we tussle, mind your business
So, so, so, so, so slew
That's my girl, we CEOs
And dancin' like a C-E-ho
We about to throw them bows
Let's fuck it up

Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
Yeah, this the type of fight I'm lookin' for
Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
Yeah, this the type of fight I'm lookin' for
Where my girls, where my girls at? (Woo-hoo)
