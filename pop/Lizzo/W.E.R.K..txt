B-B-B-B, B-B-B-B, B-B-Big GRRRL
S-S-S-S, S-S-S-S, S-S-Small World
I be-be-be-be-be-be-be steppin' on my deities
Sweet like diabetes, if you want me, hide and seek
I be flossin' super hard on your bumpin' gums
Ominous, music be like (dum dum dum)
Lizzo never scared, bone crushin', you's a fuckin' ho
Vibrations spillin' from your head to your baby toe
Nigga, you's a baby fro, I be pick-ed out, soul glow
Actin' like you ain't been told
Summer's mine so please stay cold (brr-brr brr brr!)
Summer's mine so please stay cold
Dinner's mine, eat yo' waffles
 (x2)
Look like a girl, act (like a lady)
Think like a man but work like a boss
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)

I need to remind you that you talkin' to The Chalice
I am woman, hear me rawr, Queen of the Wonderland, not Alice
And if you wanna get wit' it, house so little, you not rented
Take out that mortgage and spend it and you'll get zero percentage
(If I said it), I did it, if I did it, I meant it
Actions bring the pain like Dennis the Menace
Slingshot, David and Goliath on them boys
'Cept when this tree falls, yes, it will make a noise
(Timber! Boom!)
Testosterone in the room, I break it up with estrogen
I ain't tryna get chose, I'm already chosen
