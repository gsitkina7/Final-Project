Look up in the mirror, oh my God, it's me
So much Prada on me, I'm a Pradagy
I'ma do my thing, no apologies
Coconut and rose in my skin regime

Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me what you see
It's that, oh my God, it's lookin' heavenly (Ooh)
Poppin' Power Rangers, purple, yellow, pink
Throwin' ones, wonder what my mama think
Feelin' like a stripper when I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'll be slappin' on that ass, gettin' thicker and thicker (Ooh)

I don't see nobody else (Ooh)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh)
I don't see nobody else (Ooh)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)

Look up in the mirror, oh, I'm having visions
Feelin' like a million, ooh, I can get it (Aah)
Who that is (Aah), her over there (Aah)
Lookin' good (Aah), feelin' yourself

Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me what you see
It's that, oh my God, it's looking heavenly (Ooh)
Ooh, I'll mix the Yaki with the Cherokee
Throwin' ones, wonder what my mama think

Feelin' like a stripper when I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'll be slappin' on that ass gettin' thicker and thicker (Ooh)
I don't see nobody else (Ooh)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh)
I don't see nobody else (Ooh)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Yeah, hoo-hoo-hoo, ah yeah)

Feelin' like a stripper when I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'll be slappin' on that ass, gettin' thicker and thicker
Okay, now spoon the yams, now stir the soup
That spoon, spoon, that spoon, spoon (Ooh)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't need a crown to know that I'm a queen
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
I don't need a crown to know that I'm a queen (Ooh)

I don't see nobody else (Yeah, ooh)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
('Scuse me while I feel my—)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
('Scuse me while I feel)
I don't see nobody else (Ooh)
(I don't see nobody else)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
('Scuse me while I feel my—)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Myself)
