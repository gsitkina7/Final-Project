1 A.M. and the night just keeps on callin', ooh
We on demon time until tomorrow mornin', ooh-wee (Say less)
Bitch, say less, express yourself
Bitch, get dressed, un-stress yourself
It's cold outside, so what? Let's take a walk

Tonight, I wanna be nobody else (Nobody else)
This costume feels so real, almost scared myself
Dance the night away
(Keep it pussy poppin', pop those percolates)
Everybody's gay, yeah
(It's a happy place in here, baby, you're safe)
We can take our mask off
We can all ball and parlay
I can hardly wait
(At 3 A.M., the frеak come out the cage)

Mm, yеah, there's a Mona Lisa moanin' in the room, mm
Tell a sexy nurse to meet me in the loo, ooh, yeah
Sisters drinkin' bitches brew
The mister got a monster too (Big dick)
It's gettin' freaky, do you wanna leave the ball? (Hell nah)

Dance the night away
(Keep it pussy poppin', pop those percolates)
Everybody's gay, yeah
(It's a happy place in here, baby, you're safe)
We can take our mask off
We can all ball and parlay
I can hardly wait
(At 3 A.M., the freak come out the cage)

Freaky nights
Crazy times
Let's play dress up, baby

Dance the night away
(Keep it pussy poppin', pop those percolates)
Everybody's gay, yeah
