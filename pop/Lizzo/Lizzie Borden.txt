Inspiration? Let me think about it
Violation? No doubt about it
Man on the run, man under fire
They 'bout burn him up, the drones have him surrounded
Click, click, click, boom, pound it
Click, click, hashtag, pound sign it
It's on your trending map, co-sign it
But when they come, please do not run
Just open your mouth unto Zion
Big bear, little human
A lot of salt, a little cumin
Add it to the pot, and light it up
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you
Click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, click, boom
Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden

Runnin' up under the system, wonderin' if you can miss him
Coverin' up with a black scarf
Tell me the difference, you can't tell
Washing all the brains, nasty with the fangs
Shooting all the shooters, got my looters in this thing, like
"We don't give no fucks"
Plus we got the antidote, blacker than a quarter note
Play niggas like a pentatonic scale, go to hell
You don't know me, but I know you very well
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
We
And you
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you
We
(Click, click, boom)
You
(Click, click, boom)
Don't
(Click, click, click, boom)
Harm
We
(Click, click, boom)
You
(Click, click, boom)
Don't
(Click, click, click, boom)
Harm
(Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden)

We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you
I run nasty Liberace
