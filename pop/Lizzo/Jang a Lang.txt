Uh, yeah
Melanie, Melanie, you made a facsimile, uh
Big-booty Judy with too much to do this, uh
Back stabbing second cousins to Brutus
Self-righteous, like she crucified Judas
Go Melanie, go Melanie
For every day is "dress-like-she-fittin'-to-see-a-crush day"
Don't it get a liitle bit mundane?
Tell it like I see it, 'cause it's too fake, too fake, ok
Fac- fa- fac- fac- facsimile

Building quite a, quite a little brick-gays
NDB tis-bee thirs-tay
Salty bath water, quench-ay, daddy
Dripping like water, dripping, the faucet
Drya de love-za
Jumping Jehosephat, these hovas don't come with it, uh
Dig deeper than Bradley P-I-T-T's
I'm pimpin', I'm pimpin' now
Stop people who grippin'
Don't ask too much questions, I'm all in my feelings

"So quirky"
"I wish there more guys that would just, like holler at me and touch all over my ass and my titties"
"Oh my God, I just love your afro"
"If a guy doesn't wanna fuck me, what am I?"
Ok, I'm seein' my reflection and I'm breakin' it off
Melanie on Baywatch, the Hassel and Hoff
Enough pomp and circumstance to tassel us off
Worth more than the 10 days at Fogo de Chao
That shit be the noycest, sometimes the noycest thinks Toightest
Like your personal chanel dog
Now you know you eatin' at Taco Bell, y'all
The spell's all been broke, say "Bye" to "Aw, hell naw"
"I mean, can I touch it?"
"Aw, hell naw"
