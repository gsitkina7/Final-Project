Aw yeah, ha-ha-ha
South west alief Texas not born but raised
I was kicking it in the west
But mostly down in the trae
Or maybe montrose for a picnic
Galleria boy I was getting it
Playing shows spreading my name
But it was so hot the summer's insane
At South by South West
I was put to the Johnny test
They wanted a freestyle battle
Ok, pants vs dress
One little line
And them boys was impressed
Ditched the southwest to Minneapolis
I pull up to the Minne and get buck wild
Moving it shaking it by the pound
West bank, wild n out
Trying to see what that’s all about
First ave was recently
My niggas sold it out for a week
I step on the stage
The scene was serene
They ask my name
Said it was Queen
I don’t what that means
But I know that its good
Nefertiti flow gives you Anuksun wood
Estrogen's in this testosterone heir
So I’m going to sit in my throne
And you can get in your chair

I’m from that south west alief texas
Boy we reckless
Diamonds in our teeth
Shining brighter than your necklace
Aw snap, I got it like that
Writing raps to the boom bap
Setting off a click track
Lyrical, spherical, psych
Just mobbin
And if you got that guap
You better watch it cause we rob you
Ben Taub you, life support
Straight As in life check my progress report
Address my court with piercing eyes
Your knees are shaking can’t hold your thighs
I’m barely phased, hardly surprised
I’ve been the queen, you’re just another guy
Marty McFly, boy you better think
I’m throwing everything at you like the kitchen sink
Yep, so you can sit in your chair x3
I going to sit in my throne and you can sit in your chair x3
I’m throning
