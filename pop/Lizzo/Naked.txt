Welcome to my body, I know it's nice to meet it
Fantasies been written 'bout the beauty and the sweetness
Can I be discreet with you? Will you keep all my secrets?
I just wanna lay it down and open up the deepness

All the conversations say I should feel a way
I don't care what people think or spin or sway
We can run away (Yeah)
Let down my guard
Undo my robe
I'm standin' here
Don't need no clothes
I'm naked
Love how you look at me naked
Come make this body feel sacred
I'm a big girl, can you take it?
Naked

Beauty is a gift, but curses everyone that chase it
I wish we could live without no body expectations
I've seen every part of me and, babe, I can't erase it
If I get on top of you, you promise to embrace it?

Let down my guard (Let down my guard)
Undo my robe (Undo my robe)
I'm standin' here
Don't need no clothes

I'm naked
Love how you look at me naked
Come make this body feel sacred
I'm a big girl, can you take it?
Naked (Ooh, woah)
Ooh, ooh

Let down my guard
Undo my robe
I'm standin' here
Don't need no clothes

I'm naked
Love how you look at me naked
Come make this body feel sacred
I'm a big girl, don't you waste it
Naked

Ooh, shit
