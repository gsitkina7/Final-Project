I'm under pressure and it's all on me
Don't wanna stress ya, but you're all I need
I wanna text ya these fire nudies
The sass on your screen, I feel so complete
Ooh, let me make a list
'Cause you're beautiful and smart, fuckin' talented
You're by my side, I don't need no wish
I love you, bitch

I love you, bitch (I love you)
I love you, bitch (Yeah, I love you)
I love you, bitch (I love you, B)
I never thought I'd say this
I love you, bitch (I love you)
I love you, bitch (Yeah, I love you)
I love you, bitch (I love you, B)
I nevеr thought I'd say this
Uh, yeah, you are the most spеcial-est
Not just that bitch, but you my bitch
You water all your plants and eat your veggies
I'm obsessed with it
I was at my lowest, your girl was goin' through it
Remember, remember? Ooh
I said, gimme your heart, no repo
Figured me out, no cheat code
Gimme your hoodie when I'm cold
Bless your heart, it's too small
Why don't you try?
Do a little slow dance
'Cause life goes way too fast

I love you, bitch (I love you)
I love you, bitch (Yeah, I love you)
I love you, bitch (I love you, B)
I never thought I'd say this
I love you, bitch (I love you)
I love you, bitch (Yeah, I love you)
I love you, bitch, hey (I love you, B)
I never thought I'd say this

I love you, bitch
I love you, bitch
I love you, bitch
I never thought I'd say this
