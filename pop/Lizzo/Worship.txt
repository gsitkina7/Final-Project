Oh, here it goes

I feel like fire
I feel like rain
I can take you higher
But you gotta earn it

Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it
Woo, stand back, let me do my shit
Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it, woo
Hands to the sky
Show me that you're mine
Hands to the sky
Show me that you're mine
And baby, worship me
Worship me
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me

Feel that lightning
Down in my soul
And if you wanna feel the thunder, baby
Better let me know, let me know

Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it
Woo, stand back, let me do my shit
Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it, woo

Hands to the sky
Show me that you're mine
Hands to the sky
Show me that you're mine
And baby, worship me
Worship me (Uh-huh)
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me
(Oh, here it goes, okay)
Stop and smell my roses, posies
Appreciate my poses, they know
I'ma fanfare like the star-spangled
Oh, say, can you see my angles?
'Cause I'm hotter than the, I'm hotter than the stovetop
You can put your kettle on, but I'ma make the thing pop
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout my word, just my work
You can add it all up while I'm beefin' up my purse

Hands to the sky
Show me that you're mine (Make me believe it)
Hands to the sky
Show me that you're mine (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
And, baby, worship me (Worship me)
Worship me (Get it together, make it feel good)
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me (Mm)
