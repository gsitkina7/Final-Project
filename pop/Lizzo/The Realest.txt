( Make it harder)
(It could all, it could all be so simple)
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear-appear-appear
(Gotta step yo game up)

What y'all want me to say, young man?
I am one woman
And my time is how you say expensive
I see they waste time on them expletives
I'm all verbs baby, let's go, you cute
I'm feeling sadistic, you will do
Another one if you got the juice
To pass around, it's for my crew
Yeah, he loving the crew
He wanna get booed, just do what it do
The turnover's too predictable
Can I tell the truth?
You might not make it so come get it babe
Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up

What you know, what you know
What you know about falling in love with yourself?
Every day looking in the mirror
Think I found the proof for my health or my wealth
Yeah, laid up in this hotel
Sparkling bubbles and a pear
55 minutes till my sound check
Singing ain't the worse way they on a planet, jet
I'm taking all of my time, all of it
Body working hard, shower head
Sprinkling the stress away, tell em Lizzo wanna wait
But I'mma be looking real good when I get there, whoo!
Got a lot of problems, my niche ain't one
I slid right in, no swish, And1
I could have em if I want em, these boys is fun
Got em picking off the petals, baby one by one

Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up
( Make it harder)
(It could all, it could all be so simple)
Like you want me to go
 like you want me to go
Like you want me to stay, like you want me to go

Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up
