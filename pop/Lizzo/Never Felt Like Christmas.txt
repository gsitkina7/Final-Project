Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas
Sugar plums and candy canes, they did nothing for me
You could find me home alone and ordering Chinese
But now I save that old fruit cake 'cause there's enough for two
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with
You, you, oh, you, you, you, you, you, you

The nutcracker was boring and the carolers off-key
I never saw a miracle on 50-something Street
But now I'm singing, bells are ringing, everything is new
I'm fa-la-la-la-la-ling into love with you, ooh ooh oh, you
All these years, I've been let down until you came around
It never felt like Christmas

January, February, April, March and May
Come and go when I'm alone, December felt the same
But when I see that red and green, now I don't feel so blue
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you
('Til I spent it with you, 'til I spent it with you)
'Til I spent it with you, baby ('Til I spent it with you)
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you
