I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)

My hands are cold
My lips are tired, tryin' to blow (blow!)
To give them warmth
It's not enough, one heart alone
Cannot suffice
It simply can't, I've done the math
But in due time
There is no chance, for love
I try to try (see the love through)
I try, to try

Your skin is warm
It keeps me up though I am tired
I’m tryin' to know
What else? Why else has this happened?
One man alone
Cannot suffice, I’ve done the research
Ignore the role
Inside my bed, your lion features (no!)
You can't lay on my shoulder
There are spikes and scales
And your cheek would just depress me
(In) a heavy haze, we love it
Love the taste of it, (you clench your jaw)
We love it, (you love it!)

Humanize me, baby
Humanize me, baby
I try!

I try to try, I, I (see the love through)
I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
Who's gonna open the door?
(By your side standing)
(I will be there by your side standing)

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby, ooh!)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)

You smell so good
You’re broke
Broken
