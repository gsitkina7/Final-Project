I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, and just like the river, I've been running ever since

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

And I go to my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
And I pray he won't keep knockin' me
Down on my knees

There were times when I felt we couldn't last for long
But now I know I have all to carry on

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

Thank you to everyone working hard to keep us safe
Thank you to everyone staying home and keeping themselves safe
I love you, we got this
We'll get through this together
