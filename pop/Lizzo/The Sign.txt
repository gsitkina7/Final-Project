Hi, motherfucker, did you miss me?
I've been home since 2020
I've been twerkin' and makin' smoothies
It's called healing
And I feel better since you seen me last
I've been trainin', I can flex that ass
So when I shake it, I can shake it fast
Make that camera flash, camera flash, camera flash

If you're lookin' for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Ooh-ooh)
And I know you see me comin' 'cause I'm thick (Ooh-ooh)
I got that, "Oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store"
Woah, now you kno-ow
If you're lookin' for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Ooh-ooh)
And I know you wanna fuck with me again (Ooh-ooh)
I got that, "Oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store"
Woah, oh
Uh, just a second, let me fix my wig, yеah
Dealin' with him put me through some shit, yеah
But I can't forget I'm still that bitch, yeah
I live inside his head and pay no rent, yeah, it's lit, yeah, uh
Big rich, big sad, I'm cute when I'm mad
Bitch, I fell off, but I'm back, you're back
I'm worth my weight, I'm two hours late
But I'm on my way, ho (Hey)

If you're lookin' for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Ooh-ooh)
And I know you see me comin' 'cause I'm thick (Ooh-ooh)
I got that, "Oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store"
Woah, now you kno-ow
If you're lookin' for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Ooh-ooh)
And I know you wanna fuck with me again (Ooh-ooh)
I got that, "Oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store"
Woah, now you kno-ow

I keep on writin' these songs
'Cause he keep on doin' me wrong
And my girls keep singin' along
Like ah-ooh, ah-ooh (Hey, hey, hey)
Don't need that energy, bitch, I'm a Tesla
Hey, hey, F-O-B on the dresser
Don't need that energy, bitch, I'm a Tesla (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Hey, hey, F-O-B on the dresser
