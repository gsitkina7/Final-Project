(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh

I've learned to love me as myself
But when I'm with somebody else
I question everything I know
How can you say I'm beautiful?

When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid
'Cause if you love me, you love all of me (Ooh)
Or none of me at all

I accept the things that I can't change about you (Ooh)
But can't accept the fact that I can't change myself too, uh (Ooh)
Wish I could fall in love with me so easily like you did (Ooh)
Bein' good to me like I am someone else seems so backhanded

When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid, oh

If you love me, you love all of me
Or none of me at all

All (Oh, ooh), everything the light touches
All, baby, give me light touches (Woo)

When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid (Oh, yes)
When the world can't look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
When the darkness takes over my mind (Takes over my mind)
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't you be afraid, no, no, no, no, no
When the rain falls and I'm locked outside (Woo)
Will you be there, standin' by my side? (Standin' by my side)
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid, no, no
If you love me, you love all of me
And if you love me, you love all of me
Or none of me at all

If you love me (Ooh)
If you love me (Ooh)
If you love me (Ooh)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
