Hallelujah

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Oh, nothing breaks like my heart

I heard you on a phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking (Yeah, it's smoking)
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that we fall apart
We're broken (We're broken)
Mmm, and nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now
[Chorus
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar (Crash in the dark)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Oh, nothing breaks like my heart

We'll leave each other cold as ice and high and dry
The desert wind is blowin' (Yeah, it's blowin')
Oh, remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

Oh, and nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now
And nothing, nothing, nothing

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar, oh (Crash in the dark)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like my heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like my heart
And nothing, nothing, nothing
(And nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now)
Unbreak my heart, yeah
(And nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now)
Save us now
