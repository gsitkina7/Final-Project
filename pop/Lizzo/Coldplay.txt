Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do
And everything you do

In Tulum, we pretended we're married
And that little tiny house was our home
It was so freein' to know that we made it
To know that I never ever will be alone
All we had was time
And at the front of my mind
I was so close to leavin' the world behind with you, ooh-ooh

And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you
(And everything you do)

Goin' to sleep, holdin' hands at the sunrise
Wakin' up, holdin' hands in the rain
I feel so goofy, I don't really do this
But with you is healin' how I feel pain

It made me sad, I cried
Singin' Coldplay in the night
Dancin' to no music just feels right with you, ooh-ooh

And I just know it (I just know it)
That in this life (Ah)
My love is you
(And everything you do)
And I just know it (I just know it)
That in this life (Ah)
My love is you
(And everything you do)

My defense mechanism kicks in
Makes me run, run away from the real
It's easy to cut you down while I close me up
Instead of tellin' you how I feel
And we waited so long, but the sex is so good
Five years in the makin', didn't know if we would
Do you say this shit to other people?
I don't think that I could (I don't think that I could, no)
I don't think that I could (I don't think that I could, no)
I don't think that I could (I don't think I could)
I don't think that I could (I don't think I could)
I don't think that I could (Ooh, ooh)

And I just know it (I just know it)
That in this life (Ah)
My love is you (You, you, you, you, you, oh)
(And everything you do)
And I just know it (Ba-da-ba-ba, I just know it)
That in this life (Ba-da-ba-ba, ah)
My love is you (You, you, you, ooh-ooh)
(And everything you do)
