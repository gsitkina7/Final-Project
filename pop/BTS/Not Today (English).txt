All the underdogs in the world
A day may come when we lose
But it is not today
Today we fight

No, not today
Flowers wither eventually
But no, not today
Today is not that day
No no, not today
Not yet a day to die
Too good day
No no, not today
No no no, not today
Yeah we are EXTRA
But still part of this world
Extra + Ordinary
That’s nothing at all
We won’t ever die today
Light shines through the darkness
It wants a new world and you
Oh baby yes I want it

If you can’t fly, then run
Today we will survive
If you can’t run, then walk
Today we will survive
If you can’t walk, then crawl
Even if you have to crawl, gear up
Aim your gun! Ready! Fire!

Not not today! Not not today!
Hey crow-tits everyone hands up
Hey friends everyone hands up
Hey if you believe me hands up
Gun! Ready! Fire!
Don’t die, don’t ask, scream
Not not today
Don’t kneel, don’t cry, raise your hands
Not not today
Hey Not not today
Hey Not not today
Hey Not not today
Gun! Ready! Fire!

Too hot, success is doublin’
Too hot tumbling in the charts
Too high we on trampoline
Too high someone stop us

We couldn’t fail
Because we believed in each other
What you say yeah
Not today yeah
We will never die today yeah

I believe in you by my side
Together we won’t die
I believe in you by my side
Together we won’t die
I believe in the word together
I believe in BTS
Aim your gun! Ready! Fire!
Not not today! Not not today!
Hey crow-tits everyone hands up
Hey friends everyone hands up
Hey if you believe me hands up
Gun! Ready! Fire!

Don’t die, don’t ask, scream
Not not today
Don’t kneel, don’t cry, raise your hands
Not not today
Hey Not not today
Hey Not not today
Hey Not not today
Gun! Ready! Fire!

Throw it up! Throw it up!
Forget about the fear in your eyes
Break it up! Break it up!
Break the glass ceiling that cages you
Turn it up! (Turn it up!)
Burn it up! (Burn it up!)
Until the day of victory (fight!)
Don’t kneel, don’t collapse
That’s (do) not today!

Not not today! Not not today!
