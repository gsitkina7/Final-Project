Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
Do your thang
Do your thang with me now

What's my thang
What's my thang tell me now
Tell me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ayy, the heart no longer races
When the music starts to play
Tryna' pull up
Seems like time has stopped
Oh that would be my first death
I been always afraid of

If this can no longer resonate
No longer make my heart vibrate
Then like this may be how
I die my first death
But what if that moment's right now
Right now

Heartbeat pulsing slow in my ears
Bump, bump, bump
Trying to escape with no avail
Jump, jump, jump
No song affects me anymore
Crying out a silent cry

Ocean with all light silenced shut yeah, yeah, yeah
My wandering feet held in a rut yeah, yeah, yeah
Every noise and sound's been cut yeah, yeah, yeah
Killin' me now, killin' me now
Do you hear me yeah

Sinking slowly like in a trance nah, nah, nah
Struggle but it's all ocean floor nah, nah
Every moment becomes eternity yeah, yeah, yeah
Film it now, film it now
Do you hear me yeah

Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
What's my thang
What's my thang tell me now
Tell me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Deeper, yeah I think I'm goin' deeper
I keep losing focus
Please free me
Let my own feet carry me
But far within
In the deepest depths, I saw myself

Slowly, I open my eyes
I'm in my workroom, it's my studio
The darkness go darkly in a throe
But I'll never get dragged away again
Inside, I saw myself, myself

Heartbeat racing in my ears
Bump, bump, bump
Eyes wide open into my forest
Jump, jump, jump
Nothing can devour me
I shout out with ferocity

Ocean with all light silenced shut yeah, yeah, yeah
My wandering feet held in a rut yeah, yeah, yeah
Every noise and sound's been cut yeah, yeah, yeah
Killin' me now, killin' me now
Do you hear me yeah

Sinking slowly like in a trance nah, nah, nah
Struggle but it's all ocean floor nah, nah
Every moment becomes eternity yeah, yeah, yeah
Film it now, film it now
Do you hear me yeah

Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
Do your thang
Do your thang with me now

What's my thang
What's my thang tell me now
Tell me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
