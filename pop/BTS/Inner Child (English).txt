At that time, we had it tough
While looking up at those stars in the sky, too far out of reach
You at that time, didn't believe in galaxies
But I saw it, a silver galaxy

It must have hurt, it must have been so difficult
I ran towards the endless light

It tingles, that summer day's air
The cold sounds of the grey-lit streets
I draw in a breath and knock at your door
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change

Now I wish we would smile more
It will be okay, because today's me is doing fine
Yesterday's you, now it's all clear
I want to hug the many thorns in the budding rose

The smiling kid, the child who was always laughing brightly
When I see you like that, I can't help smiling

It tingles, that summer day's air
The cold sounds of the grey-lit streets
I draw in a breath and knock at your door
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change

Tonight, if I reach my hand to yours
Can you hold that hand?
I'll become you
You just have to look at my galaxies
Be showered with all those stars
I'll give you my world
The lights illuminating your eyes
They're the me of now
Youâ€™re my boy, my boy
My boy, my boy, my boy

We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
We gon' change
