You're in danger
You're in danger
You're in danger
You're in danger

It's always like this, you are you, I am me
That's your kind of formula
Your cellphone is just an accessory
Am I really your boyfriend? Iâ€™m sick of this
Why do you put off your feelings like homework?
Are we doing business? Or do you hate me?
Be more affectionate
Today I put a spell on you again

We're like parallel lines, looking at the same spot but so different
You're the only one I have
But why do I feel like you're not there
You ask me "Are you mad at me?" when I'm down
Have you ever done anything to make me down?
You're cute and I'm just pathetic
Hope a miracle happens so that you love me more than I love you

You don't have me, but I'm so full of you
I'm going crazy
So why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool out of me?
I'm warning you now
Don't make me confused

Are you kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy? Uh, are you playing with me?
You're in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don't make me confused
Are you kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy? Uh, are you playing with me?
You're in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don't make me confused

I'm so sick because of you
I'm so sick because of you
I'm so sick because of you
Don't make me confused
You're so mean to me
You're so mean to me
You're so mean to me
Don't make me confused

Missed calls, unlock, you're wanted
I'm trying to find out your real intention
You always send me 1 or 2 lines of text messages
Is this the relationship I've wanted and dreamed of?
Where did all the love stories go?
Get the main characters of TV dramas out of my way
I grab my hair like this hundreds of times
You look calm, you dump me

What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always hear your news from your friends
I want you, want you, uh, I want you
You're a swindler, you're a criminal who shook my heart
You used me up before you got caught on fire
My efforts to win your heart were a waste of time
I'm just a friend to you, you seem to like that more
I'm a love loser

You don't have me, but I'm so full of you
I'm going crazy
So why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool out of me?
I'm warning you now
Don't make me confused

Are you kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy? Uh, are you playing with me?
You're in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don't make me confused
Are you kidding me? What am I to you?
Am I easy? Uh, are you playing with me?
You're in danger now
Why are you testing me? Why are you testing me?
Don't make me confused

I'm so sick because of you
I'm so sick because of you
I'm so sick because of you
Don't make me confused
You're so mean to me
You're so mean to me
You're so mean to me
Don't make me confused
