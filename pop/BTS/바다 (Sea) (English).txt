Oh, ah, yeah

I just started walking and ended up at the sea
I'm looking at the coast from here
There's endless sand and the rough wind
I'm still looking at a desert
I wanted to have the sea so I swallowed you up
But I'm even thirstier than before
Is what I know really the ocean?
Or a blue desert?
I don't know, I don't know
If I'm feeling the waves right now, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
If I'm being chased by the sand wind, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Is this the sea or the desert?
Is this hope or despair?
Is this real or fake? Shit

I know, I know, my hardship right now
I know, I know, I'll overcome
I know, I know, open me up
It's the place I can rely on
Think positive, I'm swallowing my dry spit
Even if I'm nervous, even if I'm in a desert
I'm in the beautiful Namib Desert

Where there is hope, there is always trial
Where there is hope, there is always trial
Where there is hope, there is always trial
Where there is hope, there is always trial

Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah
Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah
I thought this was the ocean but it's a desert
A medium-sized, ordinary idol was my second name
Countless people get cut from broadcast
But someone's empty spot is our dream
They say some of these kids can't make it cuz their agency is too small
I know, I know, I know too
Times when the seven of us had to sleep in one room
With foolish hope that tomorrow will be different before we fell asleep
We saw the mirage in the desert but we couldn't grasp it
Praying that we'll remain in this desert till the end
Praying that this isn't truly our reality

In the end, we reached the mirage and it became our reality
The scary desert became the ocean with our blood, sweat and tears
But why is there this fear in between the happiness?
Because we know too well that this place is really a desert

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna rest
No, who cares if we rest a little?
No no no
I don't wanna lose
It's always a desert
I told you everything
Then I'll just be more depressed
Where there is hope, there is always trial
Where there is hope, there is always trial

Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah
Where there is hope
You know, you know
You know, yeah yeah

Ocean, desert, the world
Everything, the same thing
Different name
I see ocean, l see desert
I see the world
Everything's, the same thing
With a different name
It's life again

Where there is hope
You know you know you know yeah
Where there is hope
You know you know you know yeah

Where there is hope, there is always trial
Where there is hope, there is always trial

We need to be in despair, for all our hardships
We need to be in despair, for all our hardships
