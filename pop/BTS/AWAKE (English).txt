It's not that I believe it
But that I want to try holding out
Because this is all that I can do
I want to remain, I want to dream more
Even so, what I'm saying is
That it's time to leave

Yeah, it's my truth (Ooh-ah)
It's my truth (Ooh-ah)
I will be covered with wounds all over, ooh
But it's my fate (Ooh-ah)
It's my fate (Ooh-ah)
Still, I want to struggle and fight, ooh

Maybe I, I can never fly
I can't fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings, yeah
Maybe I, I can't touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

I'm just walking and walking, among this darkness
My happy times asked me this question
You, are you really okay, it asked me, oh no
I replied, no, I'm so afraid
Still, I hold the 6 flowers tightly in my hands
I, I'm just walking, I said, oh no

But it's my fate (Ooh-ah)
It's my fate (Ooh-ah)
Still, I want to struggle and fight, ooh

Maybe I, I can never fly
I can't fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings, yeah
Maybe I, I can't touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit more

Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don't cry (cry, cry)
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie (No lie, no lie, no lie, yeah)
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
No lie (Lie, lie)

Maybe I, I can never fly
I can't fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings, yeah
Maybe I, I can't touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run just a bit more
