Now it has grown to be so clear
The unfamiliar shadow amidst those cheers
Perhaps I wouldn't be able to believe the words:
"Let's see and hear only good things" no more
Your silent sadness, it shakes me
In my quiet sea, waves would sometimes rise

Louder than bombs, I break (Ah)
All the pain pour out (Ah)
From the moment I knew
The expression you had on wasn't that expression
Louder than bombs, I break (Oh, oh, oh)
Baby, I’m nothin’er than nothin’
Brighter than the light
Don’t you want a thing from me
But you say I’m somethin’er than somethin’
Brighter than the light
Don’t you give up your life
Here I stay, pray
Just for better days
Everyday a maze
Wonder if this is my place

Where’s my way?
The ground keeps quaking
I collapse on my own, mute
Louder than bombs, yeah
I want to tell you, that darkness
Exists everywhere, don't be afraid of it
Whatever night may swallow me, I won't give up
The fight for you, we’ll shine

You and I, we feel it together
Sadness and pain
It's not a coincidence
Yeah, we picked this game
Louder than bombs, I say (Ah)
I'll tell it in front of the world (Ah)
The times I've ignored you
The days where I kept running away, there won't be any more
Louder than bombs, I say (Oh, oh, oh)

People say they're jealous of us
The pain I have, they say it's hypocrisy
No matter what I do, I get caught up in shit
If not us, yeah, who will do it?
People say they're jealous of us
The pain I have, they say it's hypocrisy
No matter what I do, I get caught up in shit
If not us, yeah, who will do it?

Louder than bombs, I sing (Oh, oh, oh)
Make a promise for you and I (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever wave may sweep over us
We will endlessly sing to you
Louder than bombs, I sing (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
