On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it's over, let me know


Suddenly, rain wells up in my eyes
You well up, I see you even when I breathe
Love blooms like cherry blossoms but burns and becomes ashes
Hey girl I know, the conclusion you made by yourself
Your hand, your body, your body heat that was hotter than the equator
I'm still here, on repeat on top of the disappeared tune
I'm turning by myself on top of this music that has ended

On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it's over, let me know

Girl, let me know, girl, let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Just so no regrets are left behind
Girl, let me know, girl, let me know
Girl, let me know, tell me something
I just wanna know, know, know
I just wanna know, know, know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, Girl, let me know

The promises we made disappeared with the time we spent together
The dominos have fallen with our breakup
Like Juliet and Romeo
Did I like you too much?
The heat between me and you won't cool down
Now I look back at the film with you
Too early to do anything by thinking of you
You took away my stars at night, my sun at day
Only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
If there are hellos, then there's bound to be goodbyes?
Never ever
I don't care about that, I don't want to stick to that
I"ll turn away, hypnotizing myself

On top of this ending tune
I am standing here alone
Now tell me
That it's over, let me know

Girl, let me know, girl, let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Just so no regrets are left behind
Girl, let me know, girl, let me know
Girl, let me know, tell me something
I just wanna know, know, know
I just wanna know, know, know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something, Girl, let me know

Maybe we're all just a bunch of fools
Everyone lives with a love that has come to an end
It's not that I still have feelings for you
I know we can't work out
But why does it feel like I'm having indigestion?
As if my insides will explode
Cries come up my throat, making me throw up
In my imagination, I fight with you
Make up with you and understand you
Your hand gestures, your eyes, they are faded but not gone
Why won't it go away?
Why won't it go away?
Why won't it go away?

Girl, let me know, girl, let me know
Although I already know everything is over
Just so no regrets are left behind
Girl, let me know, girl, let me know
Girl, let me know, tell me something
I just wanna know, know, know
I just wanna know, know, know
My lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
So please tell me something
Girl, let me know, let me know
