“Name, name!” Sorry bae
“Pronunciation, pronunciation!” Sorry bae
“Diction, diction, diction!” Sorry bae
“Oh, face not an idol..” Sorry bae

Because I’m breathing I’m sorry bae
Because I’m too healthy I’m sorry bae
I’m on the air I’m sorry bae
Errthing errthing errthing
Sorry bae
The sound that I’m making now bae
To someone else, it’s like a dog’s bark bae
Why don’t you change your pattern
Of talking shit about others bae
It’s about to get boring, boring bae
I’m not hateful of you anymore
I’m not hateful of you anymore sorry bae
I’ll be the drum, just hit me hard
Let’s just try it, samulnori, bae
I’m a monster, my tail is too long, bae
You’ll shoot me anyway, bae
In that case, a zoo would be more comfortable, bae
You want it too, something to chew on, bae
You hate me but YOU KNOW ME
You hate me but YOU KNOW ME
I like hate comments more than no comments
I don’t know you
BUT YOU KNOW MY NAME

I love I love I love myself
I love I love I love myself
I know I know I know myself
Ya playa haters you should love yourself
Brr

I wanna get sleep time
Without a chance to rest, we’re receiving spotlight
Ahh you wanna be my life
Those who are starving, just be my human shield
Contacted softly and got spammed on my accord
Haul to the stage all innocent okay
But I can’t be satisfied just being here
I’m climbing up there, high high high
That’s right, my method is different
I take on the road no matter what
Sewing stich by stich
If you’re not able, put an end to it
There is no possibility
Of pronouncing “failure”
I love ma rule, the work that I do with my bros
Players in a league of their own
I’ll become the supervisor above them
So come what may
Following 1VERSE, I’ll draw a bigger picture
For the rest of your life
Continue screaming from that position
Dream come true
Honor and wealth isn’t that you
Everyone chu on my foot sole after all
Click, I’m cat, everyone’s mouse
I choose and put an X like Kaws
I move in next year ma house
And high five with my brick
Open your eyes and look at my ambition
Lean in your ears and listen
This will be the first and final words

I love I love I love myself
I love I love I love myself
I know I know I know myself
Ya playa haters you should love yourself
Brr

Back back to the basic
Microphone check
Call me a crow tit or badass
Yes in this rap game
I’m the generous one
To rehabilitate the rap man who began to slack
Is my first plan hashtag
Sucka betta run gang gang in insta
That’s their life
My life is just day by day
Payday, paycheck, rolex on my wrist
Click clack to the bang hang
Click clack to the pow
I’m so high how dare you covet
Even if you run up to it, it’s too high for you to reach
The difference is pretty big, you can’t see it
After shattering your delusions
About your shitty cars
And once everyone’s done toying with them

So fly above your face that became a corpse
Click clack to the bang, you and you
I’m always thankful, for not earning anything so easily
Why is it my fault, that your life is noncommittal
Keep on living like that vaguely
Sorry but continue to look
Because I’m gonna earn more from now
By all means please live healthily

I love I love I love myself
I love I love I love myself
I know I know I know myself
Ya playa haters you should love yourself
Brr

I love I love I love myself
I love I love I love myself
I know I know I know myself
Ya playa haters you should love yourself
Brr
