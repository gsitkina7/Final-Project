I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage right here always far from me (Yes, it's here)
I'm a born singer, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway, I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah-yeah

(SUGA)
The very first stage, named as Bangtan
Remind the mind three years ago I had
Still I'm nothing different from a rural Daegu rapper but
I became a pro, no more amateur
When I'm on stage rapping and dancing which I wanted so badly
I feel alive although it's hard and tough
I can handle it cause you're supporting me
I can stand the pain cause I can hear shouting my name
I'm in a boundary between idol and rapper
Still my notes are full of rhymes
I write down the lyrics between on and off stage
Do I look something different I used to be?
Damn, shit, I am still who I am
Did someone say I've changed? Go tell them
Nothing changed, I'm still rapperman
I still rap and sing as three years ago, I'm out

I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage right here always far from me (Yes, it's here)
I'm a born singer, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway, I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah-yeah

Frankly I was afraid to prove the big mouth I've told
How to surprise the world with something else, I dunno
Maybe I'll let you down
I was afraid of making my people down
But I straighten my shoulders and make my debut
The moment of silence, get my breath back
The people I've seen are now staring at me
Fancy TV stars are now below me
Uh, it was a very fast time the only once play has started
It just took three minutes to show my three years the fierce fought with mic
Though it's a few seconds, I put everything in, I'm fuckin real
Hey, what is your dream? Mine is a rapstar, can't you feel
The shouts after the stage, yeah, I could read your mind (Uh, yeah)
I could read your mind, no more questions, just smile (Uh, yeah)
My team just tapped my shoulder
It seems like yesterday, but already past 20 days
And let the haters hate on me, it's their job
When you play with the keyboard, I've made my career
Sunglasses, hair style, know why you insult me
Anyway on 20 years old I'm better than you

I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage right here always far from me (Yes, it's here)
I'm a born singer, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway, I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah-yeah

Remember the days we've been through
Three years, we were as one
My blood and sweat drench me
After the stage tears well up in my eyes
Every single time I swear not to forget the very first intention
Always myself, live up to myself
So we go, we go, we go (We go)
Up, up, up (Up)

I'm a born singer, just a bit late to confess, I swear
There's a mirage right here always far from me (Yes, it's here)
I'm a born singer, just a bit early to confess (Early to confess)
Anyway, I'm so happy, I'm good, whoa, whoa, yeah-yeah
