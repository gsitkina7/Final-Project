It’s at stake again, it’s dangerous again
So bad why, we are, yeah
To withstand it more, to sustain it more
So hard hard, it can’t

Even if I knew already
I can’t stop
No way no way no way falling
As time passes
It just becomes more ruined
No way no way it’s collapsing again

A house made of cards, and us, inside
Even though the end is visible
Even if it’s going to collapse soon
A house made of cards, we’re like idiots
Even if it’s a vain dream, stay like this a little more

As if there’s no such thing as tomorrow
As if there’s no such thing as a “next time”
Right now, in front of my eyes, everything without you
Is a terribly pitch-black darkness

I say it like a habit
We won’t work in the end
Even so, I keep hoping
As long as I’m with you in the end as well, I’m okay

Even if I knew already
I can’t stop
No way no way no way
As time passes
It just becomes more ruined
No way no way it’s collapsing again

A house made of cards, and us, inside
Even though the end is visible
Even if it’s going to collapse soon
A house made of cards, we’re like idiots
Even if it’s a vain dream

Slow down the time
Please stay for a little more oh
Please Baby Calm down
Just a little more

More precarious more dangerous
We are so bad so bad yeah
To endure to support more
So hard as it falls again ah

A house made of cards, and us, inside
Even though the end is visible
Even if it’s going to collapse soon
A house made of cards, we’re like idiots
Even if it’s a vain dream, stay like this a little more
