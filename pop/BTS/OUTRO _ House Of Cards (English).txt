Again insecure, in danger again
So bad why, we are, yeah
To withstand it more, to sustain it more
So hard hard, it can’t

Even if I knew already
I can’t stop
No way no way no way
As time passes
It just becomes more ruined
No way no way it’s collapsing again
A house made of cards, and us, inside
Even though the end is visible
Even if it’s going to collapse soon
A house made of cards, we’re like idiots
Even if it’s a vain dream, stay like this a little more

As if there’s no such thing as tomorrow
As if there’s no such thing as a “next time”
Right now, in front of my eyes, everything without you
Is a terribly pitch-black darkness

I say it like a habit
We won’t work in the end
Even so, I keep hoping
As long as I’m with you in the end as well, I’m okay

Even if I knew already
I can’t stop
No way no way no way
As time passes
It just becomes more ruined
No way no way it’s collapsing again
A house made of cards, and us, inside
Even though the end is visible
Even if it’s going to collapse soon
A house made of cards, we’re like idiots
Even if it’s a vain dream
