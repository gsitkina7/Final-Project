I know that you're hesitating because even if you say the truth
In the end it will all return as scars
I'm not going to say anything blatant like "find strength"
I will let you hear my story, let you hear it

What did I say? I said you'd win, didn't I?
I couldn't believe it (really) Could I win it?
This miracle that isn't a miracle
Did we make it? (No) I was here
You were the one that made your way to me
I do believe your galaxy, I want to listen to your melody
Your stars in the Milky Way, don't forget that I found you anyways
At the end of my despair, you're the last reason
For me who was standing at the edge of the cliff, live
On days I hate being myself, days I want to disappear forever
Let's make a door in your heart
Open the door and this place will await
It's okay to believe, the Magic Shop will comfort you

While drinking a glass of hot tea
And looking up at the Milky Way
You'll be alright, oh, this here is the Magic Shop

So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

Like a rose when blooming
Like cherry blossoms when being scattered in the wind
Like morning glory when fading
Like that beautiful moment
I always want to be the best
So I was impatient and always restless
Comparing myself with others became my daily life
My greed that was my weapon suffocated me and also became a leash
But looking back on it now, truthfully
I feel like itâ€™s not true that I wanted to be the best
I wanted to become your comfort and move your heart
I want to take away your sadness, and pain
On days where I hate myself for being me
On days where I want to disappear forever
Let's make a door, it's in your heart
Open the door and this place will await, Magic Shop

While drinking a glass of hot tea
And looking up at the Milky Way
You'll be alright, oh, this here is the Magic Shop

So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you

Would you believe me
If I said that I was scared of everything too?
All the sincerity, the remaining times
All your answers are in this place you found
In your Milky Way, inside your heart

You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You found me, you knew me
You gave me the best of me
So you'll give you the best of you
You'll find it, the galaxy inside you
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
So show me (I'll show you)
Show you show you
