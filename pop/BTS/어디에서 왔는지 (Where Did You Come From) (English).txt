Girl, where’d you come from?
What a mystery, where are you heading?
How old are you? Are you older than me?
You aren’t? Then I’m your oppa!
(Awesome) Your face is so small and pretty
You look fresh like a salad, so smooth
Have you eaten? I’m not just flirting with you
Wanna get some coffee? Is coffee okay?

Pretty eyes, pretty nose, you’re so pretty
Just looking at you makes me happy
But where did you come from? You’re so pretty
My heart is pierced by Cupid’s arrow
Anyway, you’re such a fair lady
Any guy would fall for you after a first glance
I have to approach you before someone else takes you away
I will make my move on you first
Where did you come from?
Won’t you tell me your name?
I’m so eager to know
So very curious to know

Where did you come from?
Won’t you tell me your name?
(Oh) I’m so eager to know
So very curious to know

I’m from Busan, and you’re from Gwangju
But we’re alike
Even here in Seoul, even there in Jeju Island
Everyone’s in love, oh yeah

Stop playing hard to get before I kick you in the butt
Don’t get me angry, before I change my mind
That guy’s no good, are you being like this because of him?
Of course I’m mad because you like him instead of me
Girl, are you kidding me? Are you blind?
The world is full of guys like that
The guy only knows himself
My heart is all yours, I only know you
Oh my, look what this girl’s doing to me
What she’s doing is no joke
If you keep doing that, my heart will tremble
My hands will shake and I’ll run out of breath
Are you saying you like me right now?
Is that how you feel right now?
I guess you’re interested in Jeolla-do guys
Oh right, where are you from again?

Where did you come from?
Won’t you tell me your name?
I’m so eager to know
So very curious to know

Where did you come from?
Will you tell me your name?
(Oh) I’m so eager to know
So very curious to know

I don’t care if you’re from the moon or the stars
You and I are the same
You’re a cool girl
I’m a pretty cool too
There’s no other choice but to fall in love
Yeah I’m fallin in love
[Chorus: Jin, V]
Where did you come from?
Will you tell me your name?
I’m so eager to know
So very curious to know

Where did you come from?
Won’t you tell me your name?
(Oh) I’m so eager to know
So very curious to know

I’m from Busan, and you’re from Gwangju
But we’re alike
Even here in Seoul, even there in Jeju Island
Everyone’s in love, oh yeah
