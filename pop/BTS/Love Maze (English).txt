Cause' I’ll be in love maze
Cause' I’ll be in love maze

Trapped in a maze of decisions
Exhausted by all the different chaos
We’ve wandered around, looking for the answer
Lost in the maze, in the darkness

We ran and ran endlessly
But all the fake noise
Can’t tear us apart
It’s true baby
[Refrain: Jimin, Jin]
We must believe only in ourselves
Can’t let go of each other’s hands
We need to be together forever

People say
That I’ll end up a fool
But I don’t wanna use my head
I don’t wanna calculate
Love ain’t a business
Rather like a fitness
I’ve never been in a calculating love
I know it’ll be cold like winter
But I still wanna try
If you push me, I’ll fall, just raise me up again
Even if I pull, you don’t have to come
Let them be them
Let us be us
Love is a maze damn
But you is amaze yeah

Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go away
In love maze
No matter what others say, don’t listen
Just let’em talk, whatever they say
The more they do, the more I’m sure
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Can’t you hear me, you have to trust me
Baby just don’t give a damn
Promise, promise me

All around us is a maze, different paths
We’re walking in this abyss
There’s a thin light over there
I hope we’re going toward paradise
Know this, sometimes lies will try to tear us apart
Hardships will try to deceive us but
Just focus on me then
In the darkness, just the two of us is enough
In all these lies
If we’re together, even an endless maze is paradise


Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze

What can we do? We did the official thing
So we need to follow the rules
Even in this wandering maze
Even on this mysterious path
We’re taking care of each other
I always think, even if eternity is hard
I wanna try it, let’s be forever
Our own mountain, our own climb
Our own world, our own heart
Travel toward the exit
Held together, our hands become a map

Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go away
In love maze
