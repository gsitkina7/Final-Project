I want to breathe, I hate this night
I want to wake up, I hate this dream
I'm trapped inside of myself and I'm dead
Don't wanna be lonely
Just wanna be yours

Why is it so dark when you're not here
It's dangerous how wrecked I am
Save me because I can't get a grip on myself
Listen to my heartbeat
It calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness
You are shining so brightly

Give me your hand, save me, save me
I need your love before I fall (Fall), fall (Fall)
Give me your hand, save me, save me
I need your love before I fall, fall

Give me your hand, save me, save me
(Oh-oh, ooh-woah) Save me, me—, me—
Give me your hand, save me, save me
(Oh-oh, ooh-woah) Save me, me—, me—

Save me, Save me (Oh-oh)

Today the moon shines brighter on the blank spot in my memories
It swallowed me, this lunatic, please save me tonight
(Please save me tonight, please save me tonight)
Within this childish madness you will save me tonight
I knew that your salvation
Is a part of my life and the only helping hand that will embrace my pain
The best of me, you're the only thing I have
Please raise your voice so that I can laugh again
Play on
Listen to my heartbeat
It calls you whenever it wants to
Because within this pitch black darkness
You are shining so brightly

Give me your hand, save me, save me (Save me)
I need your love before I fall (Fall, fall, fall), fall
Give me your hand, save me, save me (Save me)
I need your love before I fall (Fall, fall), fall (Fall)

Give me your hand, save me, save me
(Oh-oh, ooh-woah) Save me, me—, me—
Give me your hand, save me, save me
(Oh-oh, ooh-woah) Save me, me—, me—

Thank you for letting me be me
For helping me fly
For giving me wings
For straightening me out
For waking me from being suffocated
For waking me from a dream which was all I was living in
When I think of you the sun comes out
So I gave my sadness to the dog
Thank you, for being "us"
Give me your hand, save me, save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
Give me your hand, save me, save me
I need your love before I fall, fall
