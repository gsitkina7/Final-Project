I'm still standing here with my eyes closed
Lost between the deserts and oceans
I'm still wandering
Where should I go yeah
I didn't know there were this many
Paths I can't go and paths I can't take
I never felt this way before
Am I becoming an adult?

This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am confused
Never leave me alone
I still believe even though it's unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
No matter how much I wander
I want to believe in my path

Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way

I once saw an ant going somewhere
There is no way to find the path at once
Constantly crashing and crawling forward
To find something to eat
Roaming for days
You know
There is a reason for all this frustration
I believe that we're on the right path
If we ever find it
We will return home at once
Just like an ant
This is too hard, is this path right for me
I am so confused
Don't you leave me alone
I still want to believe even though it's unbelievable
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path

Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

So long
Goodbye to my hope with no promise
So long
Even if I'm slow I will walk with my own feet
Because I know this path is mine to take
Even if I go back, I will reach this path eventually
I never I will never
I will never lose my dream
Lost my way
Constantly pushing without rest
Within the harsh rainstorms
Lost my way
Within a complicated world without an exit
Lost my way
Lost my way
I wander
I want to believe in my path

Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way
