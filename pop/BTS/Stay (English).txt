Was it a dream?
I think I saw you
When I open my eyes
The room's empty again

I gently cast a spell
My heart beats louder than ever
We're always in this moment
Together, wherever, yeah
Wherever, yeah

I think it's a blessing to repeat
I don’t know what I’m thinking either
Can’t I be able to see you?
I put my hands together silently
Tomorrow doesn't change
Like a madman, I keep sayin'
Wherever you are
I know you always stay

I tell you with dry lips
Stay
Where that cloud passed by
Stay, stay, stay, stay (Always)

Yeah, I know you always stay
Yeah, I know you always stay
Yeah, I know you always stay


For all of
Today's brilliance, hey yeah
Oh, every night and day
Yeah, I know you always stay
I’m thinking of you right now
Does it matter
Wherever you are?
We connect to 7G
It ain't the end of the world
The present, it shine like a pearl
This is just the beginning
But I'm gonna change you

I gently cast a spell
The star shines brighter than ever
We're always in this moment
Wherever you are, I know you always stay

I tell you with firm lips
Stay
In the sky where that wind blew
Stay, stay, stay, stay (Always)

Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay
For all of
Today’s brilliance, hey yeah
Oh, every night and day
Yeah, I know you always stay

The cold wind blows
I take your hand, I feel your breath
Once I close my eyes
We'll always be together
