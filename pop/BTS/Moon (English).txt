How long has the moon
And earth been together like this?
You who shines solely by existing
Can I stay by your side?

You are my Earth
I'm just a moon to you
Your little star that lights up your heart
You are my Earth
And all I see is you
The only thing I can do is to gaze at you like this
Though everyone says I'm beautiful
But my sea is all black
A star where flowers bloom and the sky is blue
You are the truly beautiful one

Suddenly I wonder
Are you also looking at me right now? (Oh)
Won't you even find out all my painful wounds? (Oh)
I'll orbit around you
I'll stay by your side
I'll be your light
All for you

I didn't even have a name
Until I met you
You gave me your love
And now have become my reason

You are my Earth
I'm just a moon to you
Your little star that lights up your heart
You are my Earth
And all I see is you
The only thing I can do is to gaze at you like this
In the crescent moon night
Even if I close my eyes
You come to me blue
In the full moon night
Would it be okay if I open my eyes and contain you in them?

Suddenly I wonder
Are you also looking at me right now? (Oh)
Won't you find out all my painful wounds? (Oh)
I'll orbit around you
I'll stay by your side
I'll be your light
All for you

Even the bright day
And in the dark night
You who stay by my side
Even when I'm sad
Even when I'm hurt
You simply shine on me

Rather than saying any words
Rather than thanking you
I'll stay by your side
In the pitch-black night
Way more brightly
I'll stay by your side
Suddenly I wonder
Do you really know yourself? (Oh)
Do you know how beautiful your existence is? (Oh)
I'll orbit around you
I'll stay by your side
I'll be your light
All for you

All for you
