It was good in the beginning
Going up and down itself
We become tired before we knew it
Meaningless emotional exhaustion
Repeated seesaw, seesaw game
Now, I'm so sick of this
Repeated seesaw, seesaw game
We're both sick and tired of each other
Was the small argument the beginning?
The moment I became heavier than you
Because there has never been parallel in the first place
Maybe that's why we tried to reach the balance
If it was love, and if this is what love means
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
It seems we're both tired of each other and holding the same cards
Well, then

All right, a repeated seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, a boring seesaw game
Someone has to get off of this seesaw
I can't, but

Let's not look at each other who will get off first
Let’s not drag things out
Let's follow our hearts
Let's put an end to this
A repeated seesaw game
Let's stop it now

People can be so crafty
We know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
But neither of us want to be the bad guy
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities, umm-umm
We became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
Ay, although this wasn't the kind of parallel that I wanted
[Verse 3: SUGA]
At first, we showed off who was heavier
We bragged and smiled at each other
Now we're trying measure who's heavier
A competition between us
That became a flame, igniting quarrels
It'll only end if someone gets off right here
Acting like we're for each other
With words mixed with thorns
Can't keep doing this, we need to make a decision
If we didn't have feelings for each other
If we didn't think of each other
Would we have dragged it out like this?
Now if we don't have any feelings left
It's dangerous, dangerous on this seesaw
Stop thinking about me

All right, a repeated seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, a boring seesaw game
Someone has to get off of this seesaw
I can't, but
Hol' up, hol' up, I walk on this seesaw you're not on
Hol' up, hol' up, just like in the beginning when you weren't here
Hol' up, hol' up, I walk on this seesaw you're not on
Hol' up, hol' up, I get off this seesaw you're not on

All right, a repeated seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, a boring seesaw game
Someone has to get off of this seesaw
I can't, but

Let's not look at each other who will get off first
Let’s not drag things out
Let's follow our hearts
Let's put an end to this
A repeated seesaw game
Let's stop it now

Hol' up, hol' up, I walk on this seesaw you're not on
Hol' up, hol' up, just like in the beginning when you weren't here
Hol' up, hol' up, I walk on this seesaw you're not on
Hol' up, hol' up, I get off this seesaw you're not on
