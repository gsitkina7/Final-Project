It leaves me feeling seasick, baby
Seems like I'm locked deep in the dreamlike reality
It spins me 'round and drives me crazy
It seems that I'm like the moon in the midday

If I was only by myself
If I didn't know you
Maybe I'd have given up
Lost at sea

But my heart's still on fire
With a burning desire
Gonna get you back like it's destined

I wish that you would love (Love) me (Me)
Like yesterday, don't let go of this hand ever again
And every time my heart (Heart) beats (Beats)
Match your steps so you don't wander around ever again

I feel destiny in you, you, you, you, you
I feel destiny in me, me, me, me, me

When you hear my heartbeat, baby
You give me a new life, you give me a new birth
I feel your heart beat away
I been losing my mind, I been cravin' my shine
I know me before you was a ready-made me
But you designate me and you resumed me
I been calling your name in this universe
(Now I need no space)
I got youniverse, done

Coming across you is like a TV drama created by the universe (Yeah)
So many wanderings, being lost endlessly
It was you who led me through the labyrinth
You're my light and salvation
The rain is coming close to an end and I won't let go of your hand

I wish that you would love (Love) me (Me)
Like yesterday, don't let go of this hand ever again
And every time my heart (Heart) beats (Beats)
Match your steps so you don't wander around ever again

I feel the destiny in you, you, you, you, you
Feel the destiny in me, me, me, me, me
I feel the destiny in you you you you you
Feel the destiny in me, me, me, me, me

My heart's on fire for your love
Oh, my heart's on fire for your love

I wish that you would love (Love) me (Me)
Just like yesterday, don't let go of this hand ever again
And every time my heart (Heart) beats (Beats)
Match your steps so you don't wander around ever again

I feel the destiny in you, you, you, you, you
Feel destiny in me, me, me, me, me
I feel the destiny in you, you, you, you, you
Feel destiny in me, me, me, me, me
