Waiting for you, Anpanman
Waiting for you, Anpanman

I don’t have biceps or pecs
I don’t have a super car like Batman
The ideal hero is my fantasy
But all I can give you is Anpan
I’ve dreamed of becoming a hero like Superman
I ran with all my strength, jumping high up in the sky
I’m not afraid of little things like bruising my knees
A innocent fantasies of my childhood

I’m not a superhero
Don’t expect a lot
I can be your hero
I’m really not sure whether that even makes sense
But mom, I really need to do it
Who’s gonna do it if it isn’t me?
You can call me, say Anpan

Waiting for you, Anpanman
(Lemme hear ya say, lemme hear ya say)
Waiting for you, Anpanman
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I’ll muster up the strength a little more
(Lemme hear ya say, lemme hear ya say)
I’ll be your strength
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)

Keep spinning and spinning my Anpan
Keep ballin’, ballin’ still Bangtan
As I open my eyes, I’m a hero, but still in maze
That young man, young man, young man
Keep secretly, secretly getting covered in bruises
But ballin’, ballin’ still Bangtan
Even if I’m hurt, I’m a hero, Put the fear behind
Anpanman, panman, panman

I’m a new generation, Anpanman
I’m a new superhero, Anpanman
All I have is this one song
Lemme say “All the bad men, cop out”
I’m a new generation, Anpanman
I’m a new superhero, Anpanman
All I have is this song
Lemme say “All the bad men, cop out”

Sometimes I’m afraid of all this
Because I came to have so many things that I love
Some say, you’re almost an old fossil now
You’re not qualified, Just do what you’ve been doing before
But I still want to be a hero
All I can give you is Anpan
And a word, "You’ve worked hard,"
But I’ll fly to you right away if you call me
Please call me

Waiting for you, Anpanman
(Lemme hear ya say, lemme hear ya say)
Waiting for you, Anpanman
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I’ll muster up the strength a little more
(Lemme hear ya say, lemme hear ya say)
I’ll be your strength
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)

Keep spinning and spinning my Anpan
Keep ballin’, ballin’ still Bangtan
As I open my eyes, I’m a hero, but still in maze
That young man, young man, young man
Keep secretly, secretly getting covered in bruises
But ballin’, ballin’ still Bangtan
Even if I’m hurt, I’m a hero, Put the fear behind
Anpanman, panman, panman

To be honest
I’m scared of falling
And of letting you down
But, even if it takes up all my strength
I will be sure that I stay by your side
Although I’ll fall again
I’ll make a mistake again
And I’ll be covered in mud
I believe in myself because I’m a hero
Yeah, yeah

Keep spinning and spinning my Anpan
Keep ballin’, ballin’ still Bangtan
As I open my eyes, I’m a hero, but still in maze
That young man, young man, young man
Keep secretly, secretly getting covered in bruises
But ballin’, ballin’ still Bangtan
Even if I’m hurt, I’m a hero, Put the fear behind
Anpanman, panman, panman

I’m a new generation, Anpanman
I’m a new superhero, Anpanman
What I have is a single blow of this song
Lemme say “All the bad men, cop out”
I’m a new generation, Anpanman
I’m a new superhero, Anpanman
What I have is a single blow of this song
Lemme say “All the bad men, cop out”
