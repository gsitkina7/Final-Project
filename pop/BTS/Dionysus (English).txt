Drink it up
Shot glasses (sippin’) Link arms (tippin’)
One shot
Thyrsus (grippin’) Grape (eatin’)
Drink it up
Vibes (Keep it) D style (rip it)
One shot
Here (Kill it) let’s steal it
The illest

Just get drunk like Dionysus
Drink in one hand, Thyrsus on the other
Art splashing inside this clear crystal cup
Art is alcohol too, if you can drink it, you'll get drunk fool
You dunno you dunno
You dunno what to do with
I'll show you I recommend you something different
From my mic made of ivy and rough wood
There is never a sound that comes out in one breath

Until the sun comes up, where the party at
Until we fall asleep, where the party at
Sing it, sing it again
Drink it, drink it again
We’re born again

Drink it up (the pain of creation)
One shot (the scolding of this era)
Drink it up (Talking with myself)
One shot (Okay now l’m ready fo the sho)

Drink, drink, drink, drink up my glass ay
Everyone all, fall, fall into this crazy artist
One drink (one shot), two drinks (two shots)
Get drunk on art and say onghaeya

Drink, drink, drink, drink up my glass ay
Everyone fall, fall, fall into this crazy artist
One drink (one shot), two drinks (two shots)
Hit the gong and say onghaeya

Shot glasses (sippin’), linked arms (tippin’)
Thyrsus (grippin’), Grape (eatin’)
Vibes (Keep it) D style (rip it)
Here (Kill it) let’s steal it
The illest

I'm now in front of the door to the world
The cheers I hear when I get up on stage
Can’t you see my stacked
Broken thyrsus
At last I’m reborn

When the night comes
Mumble mumble mumble
When the night comes
Tumble tumble tumble
The bass, bass, bass filling the studio
Bass drum goes like dum dum dum (Yeah)

Until the sun comes up, where the party at
Until we fall asleep, where the party at
Sing it, sing it again
Drink it, drink it again
And we’re born again

Drink it up (the pain of creation)
Have a mouthful (the scolding of this era)
Drink it up (Talking with myself)
One shot (Okay now l’m ready fo the sho)

Drink, drink, drink, drink up my glass ay
Everyone fall, fall, fall into this crazy artist
One drink (one shot), two drinks (two shots)
Get drunk on art and say onghaeya

Drink, drink, drink, drink up my glass ay
Everyone fall, fall, fall into this crazy artist
One drink (one shot), two drinks (two shots)
Hit the gong and call onghaeya

If we pop up
Anywhere in the world, stadium party ay
Born as a K-pop idol
Reborn as an artist
Reborn as an artist, reborn as an artist
What does it matter if I’m an idol or an artist, cheers
Art at this level is over-drinking, over-drinking yeah
The new record is the fight against oneself, a fight yeah
Toast to this, one shot
But I‘m still thirsty
What

You ready for this?
Are you ready to get hyped up?
Come on

Drink, drink, drink, drink up my glass ay
Everyone fall, fall, fall into this crazy artist
One drink (one shot), two drinks (two shots)
Get drunk on art and say onghaeya

Drink, drink, drink, drink up my glass ay
Everyone fallin', fallin', fallin' into this crazy artist
One drink (one shot), two drinks (two shots)
Hit the gong and call onghaeya
