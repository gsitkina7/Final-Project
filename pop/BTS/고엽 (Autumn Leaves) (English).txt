Fall like those dry leaves
Just falling without strength, my love
Your heart just goes far away
I can’t catch you
I can’t catch you any more, any more
I can’t hold onto you, yeah

Those fallen leaves that look so insecure
Seem like they’re looking at us
If I touch your hand, even if it’s all at once
It seems like it’ll all become crumbs
I only looked
With the autumn wind
Your words and expressions that become cold at some point
I can see that our relationship is fading
An empty relationship like the autumn sky
An ambiguous difference compared to before
Today of all days, the much quieter night
One leaf left clinging to a branch
It’s shattering, I see the end
Dead leaves becoming dried
The silence inside your aloof heart
Please don’t leave me
Please don’t leave me, crumbling dead leaves
I want the you that meets my eyes
I want the you that wants me again
Please don’t leave me
Please don’t fall
Never never fall
Don’t go far away

Baby you, girl I can’t let you go
Baby you, girl I can’t give up on you
Like those falling dry leaves
This love, like dry leaves
Never never fall
It’s fading

Like all the dry leaves fall
Like all the things I thought would last forever are leaving
You are my fifth season
Even if I try to see you, I can’t look
You’re still green to me
Even if the heart doesn’t move, it moves by itself
Lingering feelings hung out piece by piece like laundry
Only crimson memories fall
From above me
Even if my branch doesn’t shake
They constantly fall
Right, my love must fall
In order to rise
Even when you’re near, my two eyes
Are far away, it’s happening
I’m being thrown away like this
Inside my memories, I become young again
Never never fall yeah
Never never fall yeah

I want the you that meets my eyes
I want the you that wants me again
Please don’t leave me
Please don’t fall
Never never fall
Don’t go far away

Why can’t I give up on you yet
I hold on to these faded memories
Is this greed?
I try to look back on these lost seasons
I try to turn back

Burn them brightly, whoosh
It was all beautiful, right, our path
But they’ve all faded
Dry leaves come down like tears
The wind blows and everything grows apart all day
The rain is falling and you’re shattering
Until the very last leaf, you you you
I want the you that meets my eyes
I want the you that wants me again
Please don’t leave me (Oh)
Please don’t fall (Yeah)
Never never fall
Don’t go far away

Baby you, girl I can’t let you go
Baby you, girl I can’t give up on you
Like those falling dry leaves
This love, like dry leaves
Never never fall
It’s fading

Never never fall
Never never fall
