Yo, right in here
BTS, we dropped the second ball
CS, the revolution started again

A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?

Dream is gone, no time to breathe
School, house and PC room is all we have
We live the same life
And have to become number one
For us it's like a double spy between dream and reality
Who is the one who made us into study machines?
It's either number one or a failure
They trap us in borders, the adults
There’s no choice but to consent
Even if we think simply, it’s the survival of the fittest
Who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? What?

Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later

Everybody say NO!
It's not going to work anymore
Don't be captured in others dreams
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!
It has to be now
We've done nothing yet
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!

A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?
I want to eat and have fun, I want to tear my uniform
Make money, good money, but they already view me crookedly
My obscure bank account, my unhappiness is past its limit
A factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle

Adults say that we have it so easy
They say I'm on my way to happiness
Then how do you explain my unhappiness?
There's no conversation topics other than studying
Outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
Who will take responsibility?

Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later

Everybody say NO!
It's not going to work anymore
Don't be captured in others dreams
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!
It has to be now
We've done nothing yet
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!
Everybody say NO!
Everybody say NO!
Everybody say NO!
Everybody say NO!
