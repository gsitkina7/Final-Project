Yeah, the most lonely creature in the world
Eh, do you want to know my story?
I’ve never told this to anybody
Yeah, come on

In the middle of the vast ocean
One whale speaks softly and lonelily
The fact that no matter how much they shout, it won’t reach
Makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
Of course I don’t care what‘s the matter or what I’ve now become
When loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
I’ve become completely alone. It's a lock that fills sadness
Someone says, “bastard, you’ve become a celebrity”
Oh fuck that! So what?! Nobody remains by my side and I'm fine on my own
These words that are easily said towards me quickly becomes a wall
Even loneliness turns into something you can see
Even if my breaths are blocked
Because I’m confined in that wall
(I) head towards the surface of water above
Hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

Lonely lonely lonely whale
Sing alone like this!
Will I ever shine so brightly like a remote island?

Lonely lonely lonely whale
Like this, try calling once again
Until this song that doesn’t have a response
Reaches tomorrow

No more, no more baby
No more, no more
An endless signal will reach someday
Everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

No more, no more baby
No more, no more
Even the blind whales will be able to see me
Today I sing again
The world will never know
How sad I am
My hurt is water and oil that can’t mix
So only above the surface of the water do I
Breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends
A child in the lonely ocean
I want to make it known too
My value, Everyday
I become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
Never end… Why is there no end and always hell?
As time goes by, it’s a Neverland in a cold abyss!
But I always think, now
Even if I sleep a shrimp’s sleep, my dreams are like that of a whale’s
The upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday
Like me, Ye i’m swimmin’

I go towards my future
That blue beach and
Believe in my hertz
Hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

Lonely lonely lonely whale
Sing alone like this!
Will I ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
Lonely lonely lonely whale
Like this, try calling once again
Until this song that doesn’t have a response
Reaches tomorrow

Mom said the sea is blue
She said to let out your voice as far as you can
But what to I do? It’s so dark here and there are only different whales speaking entirely different words!
I just can’t hold it, ma! I want to say I love you
Alone, I look back at this music sheet that’s like a rotating song
This ocean is too deep
Still, I’m lucky
(No one besides me knows of these tears.)
I’m a whalien

Lonely lonely lonely whale
Lonely lonely lonely whale
Sing alone like this!
Will I ever shine so brightly like a remote island?

Lonely lonely lonely whale
Like this, try calling once again
Until this song that doesn’t have a response
Reaches tomorrow

No more, no more baby
No more, no more
An endless signal will reach someday
Everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

No more, no more baby
No more, no more
Even the blind whales will be able to see me
Today I sing again
