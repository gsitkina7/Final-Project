I think I lost again
You look like you're mad
In a blur, game over over over

If this was a game
I could just load it again
I guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this
Real world

It'd be better if it was a game
Because it hurts so much
I need to heal my medic
But I'm another star
Blame myself since I was imperfect
Brake in my head, brake in my step, always
All I wanted was to do well
I wanted to make you smile, damn

Please give me a remedy
A remedy to make my heart beat again
(Remedy)
What should I do now
Please save me, give me another chance
Please give me

A remedy, a melody
A memory that will be left just for me
If I stop right now
If I just turn it off, will all be more comfortable?

I'm fine but I'm not fine
I told myself I was used to it
It always hurts like it's the first time

Not a good gamer, that's right, you can't control me
It keeps hurting 'cause of trial and error and 50,000-something else
My song lyrics, each gesture
I become afraid of every word, my jamais vu
Again, I try to escape as always
But still, you grab me
Even as my shadow grows
My life and yours are an equal sign
So my remedy is your remedy

Please give me a remedy
A remedy that will make my heart beat again
(Remedy)
What should I do now
Please save me, give me another chance
Please give me a

(Remedy)
Run and run again, stumble again
(Honestly)
Even if it repeats forever
I'll keep running

So give me a remedy
A remedy that will make my heart beat again
(Remedy)
What should I do now
Please save me, give me another chance

Please give me a remedy
(So is this success, I came back)
A remedy that will make my heart beat again
(I'll concentrate on reaching you no matter what, falling, stumbling)
What should I do now?
(This familiar pain seizes on me again)
Save me
(It's not easy this time either)
Please give me another chance
(Am I giving up? No, no never)
I won't give up
