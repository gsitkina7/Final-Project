My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, and tears

My blood, sweat, and tears
My body, mind, and soul
I know well they're all yours
This is a spell that will punish me
Peaches and cream, sweeter than sweet
Chocolate cheeks and chocolate wings
But your wings are the devil's
There is a bitter next to your sweet
Kiss me, it's okay if it hurts
Just make it as tight
As that I can't feel the pain anymore
Baby, it's okay if I get drunk
I'll drink you in deep now
Deep into my throat
The whiskey that is you
My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath
Take it all away
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more

It doesn't matter if it hurts
Tie me up so I can't escape
Hold me tight and shake me up
So that I can't come to my senses
Kiss me on the lips
A secret just between the two of us
Deeply poisoned by the jail of you
I cannot worship anyone but you and I knew
The grail was poisoned but I drank it anyway

My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath
Take it all away
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more
Kill me softly
Close my eyes with your caress
I can't resist it anyway
I can't even escape anymore
You are too sweet, too sweet
Because you are too sweet

My blood, sweat, and tears
My blood, sweat, and tears
