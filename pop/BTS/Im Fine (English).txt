Open your eyes under the cold blue sky
The pouring sunshine makes me dizzy
My breath is quickening, my heart is racing
I can feel it so easily that I'm alive

It's alright, even if it's not us
Even if sadness erases me
Even if there are dark clouds
Even if I'm in an endless dream
Even if I'm endlessly crumpled
Even if my wings are torn
Even if some day I'm not me anymore
It's alright, only I am my own salvation
I won't ever die in this walk
How you doin? Im fine, my sky is clear
All pain, say goodbye, goodbye

My cold heart has forgotten how to call you
But I'm not lonely, I'm fine, I'm fine
The darkness of the night
Shakes awake my sleeping dreams
But I'm not afraid, I'm fine, I'm fine

I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I'll let go of your hand now
I know I'm all mine, mine, mine
'Cause I'm just fine
I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I don't want to be sad anymore
I could see the sunshine, shine, shine
'Cause I'm just fine, just fine

(Hey, hope world)
I'm just fine, all of my pain
I can overcome without you
I'm just fine, don't worry
I can smile now 'cause everyone knows your voice
I'm so fine, you so fine
All of the sadness and scars
Became an old memory now
So let's smile and let go, we so fine
I'm so fine, you so fine
Our future will only have happiness
So put away your fear
Enjoy it, you worked hard, we so fine

My cold heart has forgotten how to call you
But I'm not lonely, I'm fine, I'm fine
The darkness of the night
Shakes awake my sleeping dreams
But I'm not afraid, I'm fine, I'm fine

I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I'll let go of your hand now
I know I'm all mine, mine, mine
'Cause I'm just fine
I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I don't want to be sad anymore
I could see the sunshine, shine, shine
'Cause I'm just fine, just fine

Can you see it too?
The dim moonlight?
Can you hear it too? (Woah-oh, ayy)
That faint echo?

I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I'll yell it out myself casting a spell
On this repeating nightmare
I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I'll keep telling myself
Even if I fall down again, I'm fine
I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I'll yell it out myself casting a spell
On this repeating nightmare
I'm feeling just fine, fine, fine
I'll keep telling myself
Even if I fall down again

I'm fine
I'm fine
