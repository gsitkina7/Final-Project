Big Hit!
(Yeah!)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
(History in the making)
We are Bulletproof
(You know the fresh hot new boys)
We are, we are Bulletproof
(This is the future shot of hip-hop)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
(We are Bulletproof boys, yeah)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
I, we are Bulletproof, W-E do the damn thing
Suckas betta out cause of me causin' some crashin' man
Your rap is like a manhwa addict, only has vanity
Why do you only have dissatisfaction every day?

You put your fists up like that every day to escape from me, now I'll send you
My rap has no guidelines, like a compass that's been destroyed
This song canâ€™t escape from humanity, that's your fate
The people who listen to my rap, they ask my name
Damn

We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof (Okay)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof (Okay)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof (Okay)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof (Okay)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
Since we are bulletproof, soon my time is
Coming, so everyone hold your breath, BP coming soon
Bangtan is running, step 'til dawn, we are rider, rider, rider
Bangtan is running, step 'til dawn, we are rider, rider, rider

You drew a dragon on your body but are you sure you aren't a gangster?
But I'm Neutrogena Deep Clean, just come out as foam
My swagga is an iljin affectation, not trying to play as a millionaire
The difference between my superior skills, I'll let you know onstage

We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
(Woah)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
(No)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
(Oh-oh)
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We're bulletproof, you can't aim your guns at us
My bulletproof, it's better than the other bastards
I don't care, I don't look below me, those who receive the bullets (Focus)
Cause I'm a tough guy, if you're gonna play just pull 'em down, your pants (Suckers)

Copying me, when I catch the bastards who copy, doesn't matter if they're hoobae or sunbae, I poach 'em
Being a good-for-nothing, being wack, okay, being fake, my body carving that history into this place
I'm the savior of this place
Ya heard we the (scratching noises) Bulletproof

We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
(You know this is the future shock baby, ha ha)
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
(You better watch us from now on)
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
(This is the bulletproof, yeah)
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
(All the haters get down)
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
We are Bulletproof
We are, we are Bulletproof
