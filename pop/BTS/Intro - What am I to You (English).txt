Come here I’m bout to take u higher
We about to set this love on fire
I’ve never felt like this before
My mom couldn’t even stop me
I told you how I really felt
And in the end, I won
Baby you should know you change
All of my negatives to positive
You put up your thorns
But I can see you’re a rose
Who’s making my heart race again
The person is you
I still don’t know but
I’ll make you know everything about me
I want to be your oppa
I want to be recognized differently than the other dudes
It might seem like a typical line from a movie
But I have a sixth sense
Yo I’ll be different I’ll be missin'
I’ll be kissin' ya all the time girl
I can take my eyes off you but I can’t take my heart off you
Now this is the beginning, I’m yo pocket monster
You gave me your heart and I gave you all of mine
Today is happier than yesterday
But why, but why

Why am I finding an excuse to call you like I’m a sinner
It’s worse than before we started dating
It is not enough that we are a couple?
You always give short answers like yes, I’m sleeping, no
Your messages don’t exceed 10 bytes
You’re like a goalkeeper who has lost her will
I’m like Messi, running all over the place
I knew this wasn’t from the start
A fair game
It’s not that I wanted to win over you
But I didn’t want to keep losing either
Even if we’re not couple-y and affectionate
I want to link arms with you like everyone else
And comfort each other and really mean it
What’s best for each other
The fact that you have a dry personality, I understand
Because I’m always below you, under stand
It’s like I’m carrying you on my shoulders
I can’t do anything
My bitter smile has become a habit at some point
And you say you don’t like me but you don’t hate me either
Am I rushing things? But if it’s not it, it’s not it
I have a partner in this puppy love
I just want to freely love
Hold me, this is like a game
Of tug-of-war without an opponent what you say

Ah, baby don’t you play
Even if you’re a fiery road, I’ll firmly walk on it
So please, don’t look at me as if
You’re looking at a stranger
When I was nothing to you
I keep thinking about those times
What am I to you girl what am I to you
I do love you crazy, uh, do you?
Like this and like that, stop confusing me
If you’re gonna keep this up, let’s write up a contract
X number of kisses per day, x number of texts per day
If we do that
Will I feel better?
What am I to you girl what am I to you
I do love you crazy, uh, do you?
