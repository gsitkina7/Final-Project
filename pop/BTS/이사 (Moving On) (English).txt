I remember how we came here three years ago
When you and I used to fight all the time
The wallpaper, bathroom, and veranda were all blue
Back then I thought this was a big place
But my ambition grew too big
That big house became too small now
When the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
Seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
Good things were always other people’s things
We were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
Seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
Let’s not forget those things but put them away
This place smells like us
Let’s not forget this scent, wherever we are
We cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
Nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

Three years felt so short but so long
A lot of things happened, there were many memories
I remember now that we’re about to leave
Traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
As much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
Fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
Maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
Even the dust will be cleared now
There’s more stuff than the beginning, I have more than when I started too
Now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
A new start, a new beginning
Excited to see how it will become
Move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
After you’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodles, that’s right
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

Ever since I was born
I counted the days for my first move
I remember, why I had to move
The machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar
In winter of 2010 at Daegu
The childish me used to measure the size of the world
The reason why we moved into a business
Was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow the money
So moving left many things with me
Whether I liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
My life was about paying rent, I know
I lived with my pride put into the down payment
So I’m gonna move again
I’m gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
When will I stop having to move again?
I hope it comes quickly
Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

Let’s move
Goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
Let’s move
Now to a higher place
While taking the last box out of the empty room
I looked back for a moment
Times we cried and laughed
Goodbye now

Everyone’s afraid of changes
Staying, moving on, staying, moving on
We keep repeating the same things again and again
I guess that’s life, I’m afraid
Old or new, new or old, that isn’t really important
What’s important is, that we still breathe and live in the same place
So let’s move on
