Seoul that used to be so unusually sparkling
Was another new world to me
I met you when you were clammy with sweat
A somewhat strange kid
Me from the moon, you from the stars
Our conversations were like homework
BFFs on one day, enemies on another
I just wanna understand

Hello, my alien
We are each other’s mystery (Yeah, yeah)
Is that why it’s even more special (Oh)
One day when this cheer dies down, stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
Stay by my side
For eternity, keep staying here, stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
Like your tiny pinky
Longer than seven summers and cold winters
Longer than numerous promises and memories

I remember our uniforms
Our memories are movies
The dumpling incident is a comedy movie yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy
Heartfelt stories filling the school bus
Now we go out to drive together
Still the same, us of those days
“Hey Jimin, today”

The dreamcatcher in my room
7-year-long history
Is that why it’s even more special (Oh)

One day when this cheer dies down, stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
Stay by my side
For eternity, keep staying here stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
Like your tiny pinky
Longer than seven summers and cold winters
Longer than numerous promises and memories
Like your pinky
We are still the same
I know everything about you
We gotta trust each other
Never forgot
More than the plain “thank you”
You and me
Decided not to fight tomorrow for real

One day when this cheer dies down, stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
You are my soulmate
For eternity, keep staying here, stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
You are my soulmate
Longer than seven summers and cold winters
Longer than numerous promises and memories

One day when this cheer dies down, stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
You are my soulmate
For eternity, keep staying here, stay (Ayy), hey (Ayy)
You are my soulmate
Longer than seven summers and cold winters
Longer than numerous promises and memories
