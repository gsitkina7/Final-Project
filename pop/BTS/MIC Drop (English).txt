Yeah, who said my spoon is dirty?
I don't care, when I grab the mic, I have several gold spoons
Several uncooked steaks over there make me mad
Once again, I'll chew you all up, on the night of the stars
Center of world business
First on the recruitment list, sold out
This class is not common, enjoy this value
Bad odors with good scents are against the rules
Mic mic bungee
Mic mic bungee
Bright lights, going forward
You thought I was gonna fail but I'm fine, sorry
Sorry, "Billboard"
Sorry, "worldwide"
Sorry mom, your son's too hot
I'm being a good son in place of you
No cons in our concerts
I do it, I do it, you're a tasteless ratatouille
If you're jealous, sue me
Sue it

Did you see my bag? Did you see my bag?
My bag's filled with trophies
How you think 'bout that? How you think 'bout that?
Haters are already giving up
My success is already so golden
I'm so firin' firin' like a torchbearer
You're rushing to run away
How you dare? How you dare? How you dare?

So many trophies in my hands
Too heavy, my hands aren't enough (turn it up now!)
MIC Drop, MIC Drop
Careful of your feet, careful of what you say
Lodi dodi, I'm so busy
Too busy, my one body isn’t enough (turn it up now!)
MIC Drop, MIC Drop
Careful of your feet, careful of what you say
This is the the exact saying
Right will prevail in the end
Once upon a time
Aesop's Fables fly
Look at your reality, too bad
Even if I die now, I'm damn happy (Turn it up)
Which country are we going to this time? (Ooh)
Spending hours on a plane (Hey)
Yeah, I'm on the mountain, yeah, I'm on the bay (Bay)
Total exhaustion on the stage, MIC Drop baam

Did you see my bag? Did you see my bag?
My bag's filled with trophies

Haters are already giving up

How you dare? How you dare? How you dare?

MIC Drop, MIC Drop
Careful of your feet, careful of what you say
Lodi dodi, I'm so busy
Too busy, my one body isn’t enough (turn it up now!)
MIC Drop, MIC Drop
Careful of your feet, careful of what you say
Haters gon' hate
Players gon' play
Live a life, man
Good luck

No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don't even apologize
No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don't even apologize

Look closely, look at your pathetic self
We shoot up just like Coca-Cola
Your corneas will be so shocked
'Cause we’re just so cool
