Among the days that feel the same
I feel happiest when I meet you
Among the different everyday lives
You're the most special person to me

Everything's fine, right? You're doing well, right?
I feel like I’m, well, floating on air these days
Thanks to having so much time
With this much time I’m writing a song like this
This is a song for you, yeah, song, yeah, song
[Verse 2: j-hope, Jung Kook]
Let's go to the blue sea
That blue sea where we used to play together
Leavе your pointless worries aside for a momеnt
Let's enjoy together and remember together
The small island in the middle of the blue sea

We may be far apart now
But our hearts are still the same
Even if you're not by my side, yeah
Even if I'm not by your side, yeah
You know we're together

Among the days that feel the same
I feel happiest when I meet you
Among the different everyday lives
You're the most special person to me

I wake up in the morning like wild grass, I check you like a mirror
My eyes are full of you instead of sleep, my bruised knees feel heavy again
I stroll the streets thinking about our road allowed us by this star
Oh, can I be your Bibilly Hills like you did the same to me (Baby)?
[Verse 4: Jimin, Jin, V]
Too fast is a little dangerous
Too slow is a little boring
Let’s try matching our speeds
Without going too fast
Or going to slow
This is a pretty long and fun roller coaster

Although we're far apart now
Our hearts are still the same
Even if you're not by my side, yeah
Even if I'm not by your side, yeah
You know we're together

Among the days that feel the same
I feel happiest when I meet you
Among the different everyday lives
You're the most special person to me
