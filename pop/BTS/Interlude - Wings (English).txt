Take me to the sky

Put your hands up to the sky, yeah
If you're feelin' the vibe, c'mon
If you're ready to fly
Let's do it

Remember when I was a child
I didn’t have big worries
This small feather was going to become my wings
And with those wings, I was going to fly
I believed and I was full of faith
And laughter

(Like a bird)
I went down a path people told me not to
I did things people told me not to
I wanted things I should not want
I would be hurt, hurt again
You can call me stupid
Then I just smirk
I don’t want to be successful
Doing something I don’t want to do
I push myself
Word

I believe in myself, my back hurts because
It’s to sprout my wings
I believe in you, I may be weak now
But in the end, it will be an incredible jump
Fly, fly up in the sky
Fly, fly get ’em up high
This is the path you chose dude, don’t doubt yourself
This is only the first flight uh

Take me to the sky
If I can fly free
If I can run away forever

If my wings could fly
I would pierce through
The heavy air and fly
I fly, I fly, I fly

Higher than higher than
Higher than the sky
I fly, I fly, I fly
Beat my red wings with all my might

Spread spread spread my wings
Lala lalalala, lala lalalala
[Jimin, Jungkook]
Spread spread spread my wings
Lala lalalala, lala lalalala

Wings are made to fly fly fly
Fly fly fly
If my wings could fly
