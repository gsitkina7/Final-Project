(Let's jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(Let's jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin' up
(Let's jump!) Let's jump
(Let's jump!) Pay attention
(Let's jump!) Put your hands to the sky and scream together, jumpin' up

Everybody say
(Let's jump!) All the dreamers
(Let's jump!) Put your hands up
(Let's jump!) Throw your worries away
Let's jump! jump! ju-ju-ju-jump!
(Let's jump!) All the dreamers
(Let's jump!) Put your hands up
(Let's jump!) Throw your worries away
Let's jump! jump! ju-ju-ju-jump!

The hero you've dreamed of since you were young
We used to jump, wanting to be heroes
But now we've grown and time has passed
You're becoming an adult but I wanna rewind
To the times when the 10-year-old boy sang the theme song to his favorite superhero comic
I wanna go back so I close my eyes and scream
But nothing changes, reality is the same
No matter who tries to stop me
I will go on my way (What)
You only live once (What)
Leggo (Leggo!)
Leggo (Leggo!)
Even if I live for a day (What)
I'll have no regrets (What)
Let's jump
Let's jump! (Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)

(Let's jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(Let's jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin' up
(Let's jump!) Let's jump
(Let's jump!) Pay attention
(Let's jump!) Put your hands to the sky and scream together, jumpin' up

Everybody say
(Let's jump!) All the dreamers
(Let's jump!) Put your hands up
(Let's jump!) Throw your worries away
Let's jump! jump! ju-ju-ju-jump!
(Let's jump!) All the dreamers
(Let's jump!) Put your hands up
(Let's jump!) Throw your worries away
Let's jump! jump! ju-ju-ju-jump!

2007 is when my life changed
It's been seven years since I've sang
A killer of girls' hearts
But sometimes, I go back to those frustrating times
Facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
That encounter awakens a different me
Now I'll go up on stage
And surprise everyone by jumping like Jordan
Ball!
Go back a few years
Taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
You used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
Letting myself go to the innocent dreams
My childhood days was impatient to be an adult
But each day was filled with joy
So can I be the one, just can I be the one
That I... stop

(Let's jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, pump it up
(Let's jump!) Throw your hands up and scream together, jumpin' up
(Let's jump!) Let's jump
(Let's jump!) Pay attention
(Let's jump!) Put your hands to the sky and scream together, jumpin' up

Let's jump and down, we are here, we are BTS
Beat down, if you're ready, put your hands up high
It's different from what you've dreamed of when you were little but we have met, we're heroes, rappers in training
Now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes
Seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
Instead of a trampoline, the place I need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
Now don't just talk about it, it's time to spread my wings and go, let's get it started
Spread your shoulders, rock your body, empty your head, let's go party

(Let's jump!) All the dreamers
(Let's jump!) Put your hands up
(Let's jump!) Throw your worries away
(Let's jump!) All the dreamers
(Let's jump!) Put your hands up
(Let's jump!) Throw your worries away
(Let's jump!) All the dreamers
(Let's jump!) Put your hands up
(Let's jump!) Throw your worries away
