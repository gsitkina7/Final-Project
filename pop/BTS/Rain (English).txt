비가 오는 짙은 색 서울 그 위에
달리는 차들, 사방에 꿈틀대는 우산들
(The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul)
The racing cars, the squirming umbrellas all over the place
It’s cloudy and the air is clear

(The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle)
With a light gray background, why am I standing here?
I don’t know if I have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all

I wake up when it’s just about to get bright outside
I brush back my hair when my exhausted hands
The memopad with the song I couldn’t complete last night
I’ll finish it today as I shut my eyes and let out a sigh
What excuse can I give? I try to make something up
It’s unfinished anyway so I’ll just make anything up
Then I turned my eyes to the window and everything looks gray
Gray city, gray buildings, gray roads, gray rain
Everything in this world is slow
My younger sibling who woke up keeps talking back
I keep opening and closing the innocent refrigerator
With the unknown empty feeling that washes over me
I think that I should just go outside
Without even an umbrella
I can clearly hear the rain hitting the earth
I smile, it’s the best background music
Like a crazy guy, I start to hum
I wonder what time it is
The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

It’s a rainy night, the rain knocks on my window, it hits my heart
With my sore shoulders, I look at my phone and see a text, “How are you these days?”
My friend’s text gets my emotions going
As I inhale the scent of the wet rain, I stretch and go to the bathroom
Then I greet myself, half asleep in the mirror
I have no one to meet but I take a longer shower than usual
Rain is still falling outside the house
I have no where to go but I take my umbrella
And walk outside without a plan
As if the rain wants its existence to be known, my shoes get dirty
Am I someone who engraved my existence to you like the rain?
If not, am I just someone who came and went like a rain shower?

The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

I get up and when I feel sore, I look out the window
As if it knows how my body feels, the rain is falling
As I look at the raindrops welling up in the window, I felt it
The tears that were flowing down my heart
With that strange feeling, I look outside and it looks like my situation
The rain that falls like a melody makes everything seem andante
I get ready and leave, opening the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face
As I walk, the moment I heard the rain
I wondered who this rain was falling for
A sound that hits against the lonely gray cement
Come slow down
The thick color of a rainy day in Seoul
I still can’t fall asleep as I fade away
The rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
I see myself looking more miserable today

Even when this rain stops, when the clouds go away
I stand here, just the same
Without saying anything, looking at the world
There, a not so beautiful me is looking at myself

In this rain
In this rain
