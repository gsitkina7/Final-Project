What is your dream? (What is?)
What is your dream? (What is?)
What is your dream? (What is?)
Is your dream just that?

I wanna big house, big cars, and big rings
But actually I don't have any big dreams
Ha, ha, I live so comfortably
Even I don’t have any dream, no one says anything
Everyone thinks the same as I am
The completely forgotten childhood that was filled with so many dreams
Don't worry about university, I'll go somewhere even if it’s far away
Okay, mom, I'm going to the study room right now
What were you dreaming to become?
Who do you see now in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live one day
Do something
Put your weakness away

Why aren't you saying anything? I thought you said you didn't want to study
You are afraid of dropping out of school, aren't you? See, you're already getting ready for school
Grow up, you are just all talk, you have a glass mentality boy
Stop! Ask yourself, have you ever tried hard?

Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Is your dream just that?

It's a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please don't force me
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
What is your dream? What is your dream?
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
Is your dream just that? Is your dream only that?
Okay, the boring same day, every day just repeats
Adults and parents cram us with dreams stuck in place
The No. 1 dream job, a government employee?
The dream wasn’t forced, a relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth

Throw a fastball towards self-study that is a waste of time
Disobey the hell of a society, grant a special pardon to your dream
Ask yourself what is your dream’s profile
Become the subject of your own life that's always been suppressed

What were you dreaming to become?
Who do you see now in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live one day
Do something
Put your weakness away

Hey, what’s your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Is your dream just that?
It's a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please don’t force me
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
What is your dream? What is your dream?
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
Is your dream just that? Is your dream only that?

You don't know how to live
You don't know how to fly
You don't know how to decide
Now you don't even know how to dream
Open your eyes, eyes, eyes
Everyone, now dance, dance, dance
Now, dream, dream, dream again
Don't move slowly, don't hesitate, wassup!

It's a lie, you such a liar (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please don't force me
(Say) La, la, la, la, la (Yeah)
What is your dream? What is your dream?
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
Is your dream just that? Is your dream only that? (Yeah)

To all the youngsters without dreams
