Been trying to tell you this
I was supposed to tell you this
This is all for you

Let’s only walk on flower trails
I can’t say that
Let’s only see good things
I can’t say that either
Saying that there will only be good things from now on
Saying that you won’t get hurt
I can’t say that
I can’t lie like that
"Because you’re all idols
It sucks even if I don’t hear it
I don’t like your lyrics
I can already imagine the performance
Because you don’t have power, you would certainly
Have done dirty deeds in the past
Observing how you act
Soon you’ll cease to exist."
(Thank you so much)
Because of your inferiority complex
I was able to prove myself something
I wasn’t able to do when in high school
Hands clapping, yes, keep on going, keep on going
We’ll be happy by ourselves
Good, yeah, i’m good

It’s okay come on when I say one two three forget it
Erase all sad memories hold my hand and smile

It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, three forget it
Erase all sad memories
Smile holding onto each other’s hands
Hoping for more good days
If you believe what I say then one, two, three (one two three)
If you believe then one, two, three (one two three)

Hoping for more good days
If you believe me then one, two, three (one two three)
If you believe then one, two, three (one two three)
Hoping that everything will change when we say

1, 2, 3
Hoping that everything will change
For a better day
Because we are together

Me, a shadow behind the stage
Me, in the depth of darkness
I didn’t want to show everything, including my pain
But because I’m still unaccustomed
I just wanted to make you smile
I wanted to do good
So thanks
For believing in someone like me
For dealing with these tears and wounds
So thanks
For becoming my light
For becoming the flower in the most beautiful moment in life
It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, three forget it
Erase all sad memories, hold my hand and smile

It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, three forget it
Erase all sad memories
Smile holding onto each other’s hands

Hoping for more good days
If you believe what I say then one, two, three
If you believe then one, two, three

Hoping for more good days
If you believe what I say then one, two, three
If you believe then one, two, three

If you believe then 1, 2, 3
If you believe then 1, 2, 3
If you believe then 1, 2, 3
If you believe then 2, 3 say

It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, threeforget it
Erase all sad memories, hold my hand and smile
It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, three forget it
Erase all sad memories
Smile holding onto each other’s hands

Hoping for more good days
If you believe what I say then one, two, three
If you believe then one, two, three

Hoping for more good days
If you believe what I say then one, two, three
If you believe then one, two, three

It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, three forget it
Erase all sad memories hold my hand and smile
It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, three forget it
Erase all sad memories
Smile holding onto each other’s hands

It’s okay, come on when I say one, two, three forget it
Erase all sad memories
Smile holding onto each other’s hands
