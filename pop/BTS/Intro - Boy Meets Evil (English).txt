The light of my future is dimming
Because of my childish love, I lost my way on a path of dream
The venom of my ambition, I sharpened my knife every day
But because of my uncontrollable greed, my knife became dull
I know it all
This love is another name for the devil
Don’t hold their hand
I shouted but I betrayed my own conscience
The sharp realities that I feel more and more every day
Red blood staining from being torn apart by reality
I never thought that
That greed would become the horn that calls upon hell
Breathe

I am getting out of breath
At the twisted reality, I close my eyes every night
The music box of tragedy echoes
But in order to be free from this crime
It’s impossible to forget it and give up
Because those lips were too sweet
I threw my future away because I was drunk in love
When I woke up, I was already surrounded by land mines
Surrounded by people’s stares that can’t be touched
I cry for a miracle in this reality
(Rewind)
It was crazy good
I was an idiot addicted to the sweetness
Yeah, an idiot
I didn’t want to let go of the devil's touch

Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet
Too bad but it’s too sweet
It’s too sweet, it’s too sweet

It’s too evil
It’s too evil
It’s too evil
Yeah, it’s evil
