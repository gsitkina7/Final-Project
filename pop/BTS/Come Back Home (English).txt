Cuz' I'm comin' back home
What am I trying so hard to find now?
Where am I continuously drifting to?

I've seen the end of my life
I feel suffocated inside my heart
What is blocking my life is my fear towards tomorrow

Angry? Hungry? Yes I'm hangry
Everyday is repeating, the future is bleak
There was no me
And there was no future

Because we are still young
There is a decent future
So let’s wipe that cold tears now and
Come back home

Why are you wasting your time?
My blood and sweat are truthful
Now, let's imprint my name on that trophy and
Come back home

You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
In this rough life
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
I will complete myself

Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(In this rough life)
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(I will complete myself)

Hunnit band, hunnit band, hunnit band
An honor to my family, to my mother
And to make my family get stuffed til their stomachs explode
I continuously work hard, work hard, work hard

Friends, don't you worry
Our future path is bright
Started from the bottom and we still going up
I still want more

Because we are still young
There is a decent future
So let’s wipe that cold tears now and
Come back home

Why waste time
My blood and sweat speak the truth
Now, let's imprint my name on that trophy and
Come back home

You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
In this rough life
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
I will complete myself

Oh, you must come back (Yah)
You must come back (Yah)
You must come back home
(Come back to my home)
Oh, you must come back (Yah)
You must come back (Yah)
You must come back home
(Come back to my home)

Cuz I'm comin' back home

You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
In the rough life
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
I will complete myself

Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(In this rough life)
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(I will complete myself)
