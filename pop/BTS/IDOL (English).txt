You can call me artist (artist)
You can call me idol (idol)
No matter what you call me
I don't care
I'm proud of it (proud it)
I'm free (free)
No more irony (irony)
Cuz I was always just me

They point fingers at me, but I don't care at all
Whatever the reason for your criticism is
I know what I am (I know what I am)
I know what I want (I know what I want)
I never gon' change (I never gon' change)
I never gon' trade (Trade off)

Keep on chit-chatting, saying this and that
I do what I do, so you do you
You can't stop me lovin' myself

Eolssu, I like it
You can't stop me lovin' myself
I like the shouts
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Oh-oh-owoah (Hey)
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
Bam badum bum brrrrumble

Oh-oh-owoah (Hey)

Face off, just like John Woo, ay
Top star with that spotlight, ay
Sometimes like a superhero
I'm your Anpanman
24 hours isn't enough
Can't afford to be confused
I do my thang (I do my thang), I love myself (I love myself)

I love myself, I love my fans
Love my dance and my what
There are hundreds of me's inside of me
I'm facing a new me again today
It's all me anyway
So instead of worrying, I'm just gonna run
Runnin' man, runnin' man
Runnin' man (Run!)

Keep on chit-chatting, saying this and that
I do what I do, so you do you
You can’t stop me lovin’ myself

Eolssu, I like it
You can't stop me lovin' myself
I like the shouts
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Oh-oh-owoah (Hey)
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah

I'm so fine wherever I go
Even if it takes a while sometimes
It's okay, I'm in love with my-my myself
It's okay, I'm happy in this moment

Ulssu, I like it
You can't stop me lovin' myself
I like the shouts
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Oh-oh-owoah (Hey)
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
Bam badum bum brrrrumble
