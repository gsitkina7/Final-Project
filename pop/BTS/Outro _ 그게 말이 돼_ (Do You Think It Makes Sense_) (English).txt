I rewind my girl baby come back to my world
I rewind my girl come back (come back, come back)
I rewind my girl baby come back to my world
I rewind my girl come back (listen)
Do you think that makes sense?
Our love changing that easily?
Without anyone knowing, as if everything’s fine
I met you but just by seeing your face, I am crying

Explain it, explain it, explain it girl
My baby explain it, explain it
I hate you so much but even now I’m thinking of you
Love is not over, it doesn’t make sense
Story is not over, it doesn’t make sense
Talk is not over, it doesn’t make sense still
Problem is not over, it doesn’t make sense

Your look makes my breath explode
Your finger that held me, that white finger
I thought it would last forever
But you changed as time passed
Your words and face turned so cold
Our relationship kept going around in place
I didn’t say anything but I knew
That there was no more room for me in your heart

Do you think that makes sense?
Our love changing that easily?
Without anyone knowing, as if everything’s fine
I met you but just by seeing your face, I am crying

Explain it, explain it, explain it girl
My baby explain it, explain it
I hate you so much but even now I’m thinking of you

I rewind my girl baby come back to my world
I rewind my girl come back
I rewind my girl baby come back to my world
I rewind my girl come back
