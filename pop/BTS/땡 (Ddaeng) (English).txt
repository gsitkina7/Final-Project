One-eight, one-three, three-eight, ddaeng
You wrong, me right, look carefully, ddaeng
Ring the school bell, brr brr, ddaeng
Hey, your life’s over, you’re ddaeng

Hip-hop? Ddaeng
Rap style? Ddaeng
Just a rapper, ddaeng
Bangtan = Ddaeng
But reality, bang
Worldwide, bang
Above the charts, bang bang, ddaeng
Got money, woo
AP, woo
Nice house, woo
Someone's dream life, woo
How 'bout you, uh
I like you, uh
I made success, uh
All thanks to you, uh
Isn't it funny, isn't it funny, ye
Don't you feel dumbfounded, ye
To be honest, I think calmly, ye
About why they, ye
Make such a fuss, ye
There's enough time, ye
This is homework, homework, ye
If you can't solve this, then your problem is, ddaeng
One-eight, one-three, three-eight, ddaeng
You wrong, me right, look carefully, ddaeng
Ring the school bell, brr brr, ddaeng
Hey, your life’s over, you’re ddaeng
One-eight, one-three, three-eight, ddaeng
You wrong, me right, look carefully, ddaeng
Hold up for a second and freeze, ddaeng
Hey, your life’s over, you’re ddaeng

Ddaeng
Mm... From my perspective, you are, ddaeng (Ddaeng)
We' all, ddaeng
No matter who's strong
I, ddaeng, don't care at all
Hunnit bae, hunnit bae, hunnit bae, hunnit bae, ddaeng
This music is shit, bae
Though you might be jealous, bae
All your claims are true, bae
Thanks to you, Billboard, bae
Nobody's above us
'Cause we're failing (Hahaha) Thanks
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you for ignoring us until now
Thank you, stadium, dome, Billboard
Thanks to you, we became successful
You small friendly companies
I hope you all become big soon
We'll fail again like you wish
So please keep worrying
Kkeut
You wrong, me right, look carefully, ddaeng
Ring the school bell, brr brr, ddaeng
Hey, your life’s over, you’re ddaeng
One-eight, one-three, three-eight, ddaeng
You wrong, me right, look carefully, ddaeng
Hold up for a second and freeze, ddaeng
Hey, your life’s over, you’re ddaeng

The cash register sound, ddaeng
When I was young, I liked to play freeze tag, ddaeng
I'm ding-dong, you're ddaeng
You're seven-kkeut, I'm ddaeng
Your face after eating ramen, ddaeng
Dregs do your thang
Look at me, I'm your errthang
You dope? You cool? You’re not cool
This is just ridiculous
Even if I st-st-stutter my words
I h-hope you understand
I la-la-lack a way with words
Bu-but I try to speak correctly but my mouth keeps ge-ge-getting crooked
Because I li-li-li-like it I li-like it very much
Rappers without haters, shut up
Where are your haters?
Look into a mirror after washing your eyes and face
Your hater is breathing right over there
We celebrate rather than being celebs
Only accel, no break
Who are you to recognize me
You frogs who live up to your name
I hope you die in that well
I'll pray earnestly, ddaeng

You wrong, me right, look carefully, ddaeng
Ring the school bell, brr brr, ddaeng
Hey, your life’s over, you’re ddaeng
One-eight, one-three, three-eight, ddaeng
You wrong, me right, look carefully, ddaeng
Hold up for a second and freeze, ddaeng
Hey, your life’s over, you’re ddaeng
