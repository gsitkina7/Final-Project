If I ruled the world I’d do it all
(Westside, westside, westside)
If I ruled the world I’d do it all
(Westside, westside, westside)

If I ruled the world I’d have it all
All guys probably feel the same
When it comes to pretty girls, There’s no racism
European, Asian, Caucasian girls
(I have ‘em)
Call Rick Owens, Ann Demeulemeester
Alexander Wang and Shane Oliver
I’ll make them make
The Kim Namjoon Collection forever
The color of the clothes would be black
Now I’m finally pleased
Music, turn it up
I’d pick my nose out of boredom
So I’ll make a song and
Make everyone on earth sing it
The title of the song would be “Ae gu ga”
I’ll be buried under pretty girls as I watch TV
All girls of the world would want me, ready to die
Boys, bring me alcohol
Or you can just disappear
Anyway, this is my kingdom

If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

If I ruled the world, sometimes, I dream
If I ruled the world, first I’ll hire a real estate agent
And buy a house to live in with my family
Yes, next I’ll awaken my savings
And buy a four-wheel drive, put in some gas
Even if it’s too much
I’ll get it with zero-interest discount
Stocks and gambling
I don’t wanna do things like that
I rule the world so why would I dream small?
Don’t ask me that because
I still want to do music with my BTS family
I will become the Kim Jung-Un of the hip-hop world
And put a ban on everything but our music
I know it’s an unreasonable dream but it’s my dream
Don’t make fun of me

If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!
I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song

Oh girl, where? Oh god, here!
All the girls of the world are in hope world, lined up
Even if I lightly spend all the money I want
Money is put into the goalpost called my wallet
I’ll fearlessly walk around the stage
Even if I don’t run, my mileage would still build up
I will soon gift myself with these dreams
I’ll shout with the name of BTS
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money
If I ruled the world
I’d do it all (I’d do it all)
I said 1 for the money, 2 for the money

Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say he-o-e-oh-oh!
Everybody say hey, ho! Hey-hey-ho!

I know it’s ridiculous
But I’m singing this childish song
