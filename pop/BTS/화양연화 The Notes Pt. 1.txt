13 June YEAR 22
After returning from the sea we were all alone.
We didn't keep in touch as if we had specifically planned not to. We merely assumed our existence by the graffiti left on the street, the brightly lit petrol station, and the piano sound from the old building. This was when the after image of that night came alive like a vision. Taehyung's eyes looked as if they breathed fire, the way his eyes watched me as if he had heard something unbelievable. Namjoon's hand tried to stop him, and I, who couldn't suppress it, threw a punch at Taehyung.
Failing to find Taehyung, who ran out, I returned to the dorm near the beach. No one was there. Only a broken glass cup, blood stains, which began to dry up, and cookie crumbs brought me back to what had happened a few hours ago. There was a photo lying in the midst of this. In the photo we stood together smiling while we posed with the sea as our background.
I continued to walk past the front of the petrol station. The day when we would meet again would come. Someday we'd smile together just like in the photo. The day when I had the courage to face myself entirely would come. However, right then, that very moment was not the right time. The damp wind blew similar to how it did that day. My phone began to ring as if in warning. The photos I hung on the room mirror began to shake. I saw Hoseok's name on the screen.
"Hyung, Jungkook had a car accident that night."
