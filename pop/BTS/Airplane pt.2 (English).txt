An odd kid
He sang as if he was breathing
Wherever was fine
He only wanted to do music
Only singing
The thing that made his heart beat
Although he walked down the only path

It's not easy, failure and frustration
Words that someone gave me after calling me, exhausted, to stop
You're a singing star, you're a singing star
But I see no star...
After some years passed by

(We still) Sky high, sky fly, sky dope
(We still) Same try, same scar, same work
(We still) Wherever in the world we go
(We still) We work in our hotel rooms
(I still) One day it works out too well
Then the next day I'm completely screwed
(I still) Who should I live as today?
Kim Namjoon or RM?
25, I still don't know how to live well
So, today as well, we just go

We goin' from NY to Cali
London to Paris
Wherever we go, party
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi (Uh, uh)
We goin' from Tokyo, Italy
Hong Kong to Brazil
Wherever in the world, I will sing
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi
El Mariachiâ€¦

Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, ooh

Every day above the clouds, Every day above the clouds
My feel above the clouds, Check it above the clouds
My chemistry with the clouds, All day with the clouds
The fun of riding the clouds, Fade in looking at the clouds
You don't know maybe
Thanks to years of flying
I got a few hundred thousand mileage
It's time to console you who couldn't make it
I'll give you the flight points as a present
Love the airplane mode, turn off all the concerns
No matter what anyone says
I'll just continue to keep the first
And look at the night sky as it fits my place right now

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Yeah how to stop
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Yeah how to take some rest
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Yeah how to fail
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I got fed up by you cutely bragging about your money on TV

My passport is about to die from overworking
You're the ones who benefitted from media, hahahaha
Hey, hey you're the ones who're better at playing celebrities
We're still the same as back then (Woo!)

We goin' from Mexico City
London to Paris
Wherever we go, party
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi (Uh, uh)
We goin' from Tokyo, Italy
Hong Kong to Brazil
Wherever in the world, I will sing
El Mariachi, El Mariachi, El Mariachi (El Mari, hoo)
El Mariachi...

Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
