Somebody call me right one
Somebody call me wrong
I’m not gonna care about it
Why don’t you not do so as well
So what
Let go

In a sigh, lots of worries are hiding
Stop thinking about it, You already know it all
In the middle of the road, in the moment you want to give up
Shout out louder
So what, what, what
There’s nothing that works out as I wanted
There’s even fewer places for me to hide
It’s already been a while since the dice were rolled
If you dawdle, you’ll be swept away, oh bae
90% of your worries are an imaginary swamp that you created
Just go instead of worrying
Don’t get scared, cheer up
Shout it out, so what, what

We are, we are, we are
Young & wild & free
Your worries, worries, without no answer
Don’t fall into them and stay in them

Even if you’re in danger on the boundary
Let’s cut through the wind while laughing and chatting
Sometimes run like a fool
With mistakes and in tears, we just go

So what
Don’t stop and worry yourself
It’s good for nothing
Let go
Although there’s no answer yet
You can start the fight
So what
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
So what

Ay some say they hate their work
Ay some say they only want to rest
Ay their pain and devastation
Ay when all those rage at me
Ay what else can I do, uh
Since there’s only one answer, uh
Let’s just trust it and run
So what?

I don’t wanna die right now
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna fight right now
I don’t like worries, Life is long
Just go, I wanna live right now
Since the brake is broken, step on the accelerator
However you do
Where’s the fun if you know all about a person’s life
Pain is my medal
So, so what?
We are, we are, we are
Young & wild & free
Your worries, worries without no answer
Don’t fall into them and stay in them

Even if you’re in danger on the boundary
Let’s cut through the wind while laughing and chatting
Sometimes run like a fool
With mistakes and in tears, we just go

So what
Don’t stop and worry yourself
It’s good for nothing
Let go
Although there’s no answer yet
You can start the fight

So what
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Somebody call me right one
Somebody call me wrong
I’m not gonna care about it
Why don’t you not do so as well

So what
Don’t stop and worry yourself
It’s good for nothing
Let go
Although there’s no answer yet
You can start the fight

So what
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
