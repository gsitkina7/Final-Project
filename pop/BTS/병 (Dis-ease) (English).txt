Mm, uh-oh

Uh, it looks like I lost something
I relieve my anxiety with a sip of coffee
An endless rest
Happiness suddenly comes towards me uncomfortably
24 hours, that’s plenty of time
I could sleep all day but there’s still no problem
I think I should work till my body breaks
I’m the damn guy who eats three meals a day
My crime, the dog bit me while I was resting
Scream “Don’t do that,” but I’m depending on results every day
E'r'yday do my thang, damn if I fail
Keep growling, tap a rotten rope
Insecurity, this is a disease
The physical stuff is a stun from work, ow!
Maybe
I'm sick, yeah, becausе I think too much
I hate that
I’m childish but not that simple
I’m just young, only my body’s grown
Limping all my life
Onе for the laugh, two for the show
Just like I'm so fine

Every day I comfort myself
They're all the same people, ain't so special
Ay man keep one, two step
Let's treat them all calmly

My disease
Dis-dis-dis-disease
Throw away
My fe-fe-fe-fear

RM, yeah
Even our hearts need a vacation
Oh, just do your job like it's one
I'm ill, yeah, I'm the job itself
The friend called ‘rest,’ oh, I never liked him
How much do you have to earn to be happy?
This glass bottle hits your head
Is the world sick or am I sick? I’m confused
I take off my glasses, but the dark doesn't blur
Whatever label is attached to me after this time
I hope they’ll all be you
Your you, you
Everyone has a lot of diseases, what I’m confused
Is that mankind is inherently evil
There more than 400 kinds of mental diseases
But no one really fits into any of these categories
Yo, is the world sick or am I sick?
Or do we just interpret things differently?
Or is that all to it?
I don’t know, changing myself is faster
Than looking at people differently

Maybe
I'm sick, yeah, because I think too much
I hate that
I’m childish but not that simple
I’m just young, only my body’s grown
Limping all my life
One for the laugh, two for the show
Just like I'm so fine

Every day I comfort myself
They're all the same people, ain't so special
Ay man keep one, two step
Let's treat them all calmly
My disease
Dis-dis-dis-disease
Throw away
My fe-fe-fe-fear

(Sick and tired)
But I don’t wanna mess up
'Cause life goes on
(Through the fire)
I'll walk more like who I am, woah
(Walk it, walk it, walk it)
When the night comes, I’ll close my eyes
(Walk it, walk it, walk it)
And trust my old self again
Now wake up one more time
It's morning again, I have to be myself today
Let's go for it, one more night
No one knows what'll be at the end, ayy
Woo, no night lasts forever
I've become stronger
The firework sparks
I will never fade away

Every day I comfort myself
They're all the same people, ain't so special
Ay man keep one, two step
Let's treat them all calmly

My disease
Dis-dis-dis-disease
Throw away the fear
Fe-fe-fe-fear
Throw away the fear

Close the window
