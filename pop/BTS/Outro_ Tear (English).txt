Goodbyes are, for me, a tear
Without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
The words that I could not bring myself to say flow down
And lingering regret crawls over my face
To me, you were once my dear
But now you're merely a bitter beer
My heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
Becomes empty even with the passing breeze
At the end of my play where breakup was a lie
The price that I had to pay came to me
If someone said they would turn back the time for me
Would I have been able to be a bit more honest?
The bare face that only I know
The ugly and pathetic old friends within me
Would you still be able to love me again like before
With that smile with which you used look at me
Stop saying things like forever, forever
After all, the end originally exists
If there's a start, I don't wanna listen to that
Words that are too correct or too much consolation
I don't wanna listen to that
I was just so scared
Because it seemed like perhaps I had never loved you at all
Although it was late, that you were true
That only you loved me more
You're my tear, you're my you're my tear (Yeah)
You're my tear, you're my you're my tear (Yeah)
You're my tear, you're my you're my tear (Yeah)
What more can I say? You're my tear

We walked towards the same place (Ayy, ayy)
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever (Ayy, ayy)
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream (Ayy, ayy)
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

(Oh) You're my tear, you're my you're my tear
(Ae-yeah) You're my tear, you're my you're my tear
(Ae-yeah) You're my fear, you're my you're my fear
(Ae-yeah) What more can I say? You're my…

Yeah, goodbyes are T.E.A.R because things like tears are a luxury
There's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes, so just begin now
Ooh, take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
That's right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
So that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
Please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
That's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
This is the ending you were wishing for
So go on and kill me without hesitating
(Ooh) Ayy, yeah, yeah, burn it
(Ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah, burn it
(Ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah, burn it
So not even the ashes remain
This is the real you and this is the real me
Now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
I've woken up from the sweet dream and I close my eyes
This is the real you and this is the real me

We walked towards the same place (Ayy, ayy)
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever (Ayy, ayy)
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream (Ayy, ayy)
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

(Oh) You're my tear, you're my you're my tear
(Ae-yeah) You're my tear, you're my you're my tear
(Ae-yeah) You're my fear, you're my you're my fear
(Ae-yeah) What more can I say? You're my…

What should I say?
We know
The answer is fixed
But replying is always hard
Why are you spilling it? Why are you tearing it up?
It's useless, to me goodbye to me is only those moments (Flashback)
The moment you say words from your mouth
The moment our focus becomes irregular
At the moment where everything is dangerous
Our end that two letters handed to us
That I won't cry, that I won't tear it up
I can't say those kinds of words. In the future I, too
Breakup, incurable disease
You're my beginning and my end, that is all
My meeting and my farewell
You were everything, step forward fear
It will be repeated, caused by you, tear, tear
