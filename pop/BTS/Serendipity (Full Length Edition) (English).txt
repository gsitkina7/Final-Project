All this is no coincidence
Just, just, by my feeling
The whole world is different from yesterday
Just, just, with your joy
When you called me
I became your flower
As if we were waiting
We bloom until we ache

Maybe it's the providence of the universe
That's how it is
You know, I know
You are me, I am you
I'm scared, just as much as my heart flutters
Because destiny keeps getting jealous of us
I'm just as scared as much as you are
When you see me, when you touch me
The universe has moved for us
Without missing a single thing
Because our happiness has been planned
'Cause you love me, and I love you

You're my penicillin
Saving me
My angel, my world
I'm your Calico cat
Here to see you
Love me now, touch me now

Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Since the creation of the universe
Everything was destined
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)

You're my penicillin
Saving me
My angel, my world
I'm your Calico cat
Here to see you
Love me now, touch me now
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Since the creation of the universe
Everything was destined
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)

Now come to me
Come and let's become a "we"
I don't wanna let go, no
Just trust yourself
You can feel it even if you don't say it
The stars are in the sky
We are flying
This isn't a dream
Don't be nervous, hold my hand
Now we're becoming a "we"
Let me love you

Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Since the creation of the universe
Everything was destined
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you (let me love, let me love you)
Let me love, let me love you
Let me love, let me love you
