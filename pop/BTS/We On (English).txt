Hey, swag, swag (Heh)
Whatever they say
I’m here for my music
Here for my music
H-here for my music
Whatever my haters
Say I’m real for my music
Real for my music
R-real for my music
Runch Randa and Rapmon
Are both part of me
The envy of the aspiring rappers my age
You guys only see what
You want to see anyway
You foolish and young’ ins
With short educations like capri pants
When you rap about love and affection
I rap about big things
Those smack-cracker dolls who are filled
With inferiority complexes
Talk smack about my sunglasses, my hairstyle, my name
It’s a sad comedy of losers in reality
My rap smothers you
Making you suffocate
Head-scratching kids who say they hate the busy world of K-Pop
Pretending to be someone they’re not
I know you pretty well
Damn fan, the public, manias
Yeah I’m makin’ em mine
Big Hit and Bangtan Boys
Yeah I’m makin’ me shine
Hooligans who will bring the value of our name
I’ve never wanted a hole-in-one
Yeah, bitch, I wanna be the one
Not number one but the only one
Swag
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you
And will continue to be so
Where are all the friends who looked
Down on my since before? We on
This isn’t a joke
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme Dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme Dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on

Whatever they say
I’m here for my music
Here for my music
H-here for my music
Whatever my haters
Say I’m real for my music
Real for my music
R-real for my music

Oh oh my haters, talk more smack about me
Keyboard warriors, make some more effort
Yes, look down on me like that
It’s my hobby
To prove you wrong
Uh my skills become a controversy
It’s too early to draw a conclusion
I’m killa, Jack the Ripper
I’ll pierce you with my sharp tongue
I’m illa, even if I’m lazy
I’m busier than you, hit home?
The haters who looked down on me before my debut
You were filled with hip-hop
Pride but now you’re beneath me
Look carefully, I’m in the majors
Jealous? Hey chaser
I think it’s too much
For you to follow
Just stay there
These lyrics I wrote myself is a hand-lib
I graduated from being a trainee, celebrate
I’m a rap blackbelt
You’re just a green belt
There’s no growth, hey guys
Feel more inferior
I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you
And will continue to be so
Where are all the friends who looked
Down on my since before? We on
This isn’t a joke
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme Dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme Dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on

2 Cool 4 Skool
Promotions received standing ovations
This is for all the
Kids who smirked at us
“Congratulations”, yeah right
You’re just saying that
For connections
If so, your senses have rotted, cut them out
Uh now our level has changed
He knows and she knows
Everyone’s number one interest
It’s too early to be awed
Look out for my future
I’ll go toward the path of my
Success as much as you looked down on me

I don’t know you and you don’t know me
So please shut up
Don’t worry about me, I’m better than you
And will continue to be so
Where are all the friends who looked
Down on my since before? We on
This isn’t a joke
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme Dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on
(Gimme Dat, real fact)
I’ll show you, I promise ya, we on

Whatever they say
I’m here for my music
Here for my music
H-here for my music
Whatever my haters
Say I’m real for my music
Real for my music
R-real for my music
