Don't think of anything
Don't say anything, not even a word
Just give me a smile
I still can't believe it
All of this seems like a dream
Don't try to disappear

Is it true? Is it true?
You, you
You’re so beautiful, that I'm scared
Untrue, untrue
You, you, you

Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you'll fly away and break
I'm scared scared scared of that
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn't happened
I’m scared scared scared I'll lose you

Butterfly, like a butterfly
Just like a butterfly, bu-butterfly
Butterfly, like a butterfly
Just like a butterfly, bu-butterfly

You're just like a Butterfly
From afar, I steal glances; if we touch hands, will I lose you?
You shine in this pitch darkness that is the butterfly effect
Your light touches, I forget the reality at once

It's like a wind that gently strokes me
It's like a dust that gently drifts along
You're there but for some reason, I can't reach you, stop
You, who's like a dream is a butterfly high to me

Untrue, untrue
You, you, you

Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you'll fly away and break
I'm scared scared scared of that
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn't happened
I’m scared scared scared I'll lose you

The small pieces guttered down darkly
From my heart, a barren noise
I don’t know if this is reality or a dream
My Kafka on the shore
Don’t go to those woods over there
My heart is still shattering on you
(I just wanted to vaporize like this)
My love that is forever
It's all free for you baby

Will you stay by my side
Will you promise me
If I let go of your hand, you'll fly away and break
I'm scared scared scared of that
Will you stop time
If this moment passes
As though it hadn't happened
I’m scared scared scared I'll lose you

Butterfly, like a butterfly
Just like a butterfly, bu-butterfly
Butterfly, like a butterfly
Just like a butterfly, bu-butterfly
