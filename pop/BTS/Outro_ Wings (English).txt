Take me to the sky (Oh woah)
Put your hands up to the sky
Yeah, if you feelin' the vibe
Uh, if you're ready to fly
Yo J, let's do it

I remember my childhood
Because I had no big worries
I knew these small feathers would become wings
I knew the wings would make me fly
I had that faith along with laughter
(Like a bird) I went on the road that I was told not to go
I did things I was told not to do
I wanted things I couldn't want
I got hurt and hurt again
You can call me stupid
Then I'll just smile, I don't wanna succeed
By doing things, I don't wanna do
I'm pushing myself, word

I believe in myself
My back hurting is for my wings to come out
I believe in you, even if things are bleak right now
The end will be great
Fly, fly up in the sky
Fly, fly get 'em up high
It's the path you chose, dude don't be scared
This is just the first flight

Take me to the sky
If I can fly, if I can run away forever
If my wings could fly
Piercing through the air that's getting heavier
Flying, flying
Higher than higher than
Higher than the sky
Flying, flying
With my reddened wings
Spread, spread, spread my wings
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Spread, spread, spread my wings
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Wings are made to fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly
If my wings could fly

(Touch the sky, up to the sky)
(I went on the road that I was told not to go)
(I went on the road that I should not taken)

Now I know I'm breaking up with regretting with age (Break up)
I made a decision, I will have unconditional trust
It's time to be brave, I'm not afraid
Because I believe I'm different from what I was
I won't cry on my path, I won't hang my head low
That is the sky and I'll be flying there, fly
[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin]
Spread, spread, spread my wings
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Spread, spread, spread my wings
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Wings are made to fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly
If my wings could fly
