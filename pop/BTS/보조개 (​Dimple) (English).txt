You hide but only appear when you smile
Where did you come from?
Don’t lie, I know you’re an angel
What are you?

But you
That smile is so cruel
Cruel
I shouldn’t have seen that cheek
You
What’s really dangerous
Is only in your possession
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

I don’t have it, only you have it
Is that why it’s so hard?
I wanna die fallen in you, I wanna die locked in you
You are my lake

Cause you
When you smile, I get dizzy
True
Please be careful
You
What’s really dangerous
Is only in your possession

That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway
Every time I see you, my heart gets dangerous
Every time I see you, it gets more dangerous
Oh baby no hey
Oh baby no hey
You’re too dangerous to live in this world

That dimple is illegal ille~gal
No, it’s dangerous, oh yes
So I call you illegirl ille~girl
Your existence alone is a crime
Was it a mistake made by an angel?
Or a deep kiss?
That dimple is illegal ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway

Ille~gal
Ille~gal
But I want it anyway anyway anyway
