(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, just one day, one night

If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (J ust one day)
If only we can be together

(Do it, do it, do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it, do it, do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it, do it, do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it, do it, do it)
A party party with only you

If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me someday, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the morning glory blooms
And part when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life
[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, just one day

If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
If I have just one day, it’s possible

Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (Just one day)
If only we can be together

(Do it, do it, do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it, do it, do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it, do it, do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it, do it, do it)
A party party with only you
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (Just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?
