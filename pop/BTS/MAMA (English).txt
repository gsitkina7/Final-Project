Time travel the year of 2006
Crazy for dance
I tightened my mom's belt
Despite my dad's opposition, every time I attacked
Without paying any concern
She floated the small boat of dreams
But I didn't know my mom's support
Was not a open shortcut road
But a road of dreams while gripping debt
Always
The problem of money eventually my mother
Go away
Had to work away from home
Through the phone
I could hear my mom's voice clearly (Hello?)
The thing I remember
My mom's strength at the time was a breaking ball to me
Really
I was determined to succeed
With that promise alone
I became the son I am now

Hey mama, now you can lean on me
I'll always be by your side
Hey mama, because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama, now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

Hey mama, I'm sorry mama
I know now a grace like the heavens mama
Hey mama, so thanks mama
You became my blood and flesh mama

I remember mom
Moonheungdong Hiddink PC room
Broadway restaurant
A veteran who ran on both feet for her family
Failure is the mother of success mother
I learned from that passion and sincerity
Wanna be wanna be
Now when I become an adult
Because you were fertilizer to a sprout
I will become a flower and become your own flower path
You walking on way way way
Hey mama, now you can lean on me
I'll always be by your side
Hey mama, because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama, now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama

You had me feel the world
The breath you have created
Today more than usual
I want to be held in your arms
What is higher than anything above the ground
What is wider than anything beneath the sky
The only one, motherâ€™s hand is medicine hand
You are forever my placebo
I love mom

Hey mama, now you can lean on me
I'll always be by your side
Hey mama, because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama, now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama
Hey mama, now you can lean on me
I'll always be by your side
Hey mama, because you gave selflessly to me
Because you were my support
Hey mama, now you can believe in your son, you can smile
Hey mama
Hey mama
