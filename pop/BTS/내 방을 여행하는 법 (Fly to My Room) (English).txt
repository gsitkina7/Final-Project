Let's go, let me fly to my
Look below and zoom anywhere
Come out now, let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Everyday
The frustration drives me crazy
Feel like it's still day one
Somebody rewind that clock
This year was taken away
I'm still in bed
My stomach is aching
It's killin' me slowly, nah
Anyway
I wanna go any way
Well, there's no choice
This room is all I have
Well then, I'll change
This room into
My world
Yeah
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Look below and zoom anywhere
Come out now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Everywhere
Was this world like this, I wonder
Suddenly it looks unfamiliar
I'm caught up in memories
The old desks and changed sunlight
Look special
I'm little less lonely, nah
Better way
I just found a better way
Sometimes we get to know
Broken is beautiful
My body is light
And it flies somewhere far away
This thing so surreal
Yeah

Let's go, let me fly to my room
Look below and zoom anywhere
Come out now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
This room is too small
Yes, to fill my dreams with (Yah, yah, yah)
Land on top of the bed
This is the safest place
Somehow it just only takes in
Happiness and sadness, all emotions (Yah, yah, yah)
This room may be my emotional trash can
But it'll hug me instead
And the toys in my room (Hi)
Greet me again like people
The TV bustles like I'm out in the city
You can change the way you think
Only I can enjoy this travel
The delivery food is three stars
Fill it with hope, I'm full

Let's go, let me fly to my room
Look below and zoom anywhere
Come out now, let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Let's go, let me fly to my room (Ah)
Look below and zoom anywhere
Come out now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Look below and zoom anywhere (You)
Come out now, let me fly to my room (Fly)
Get me outta my blues (Ah, yeah)
And now I'm feelin' brand new (New)
