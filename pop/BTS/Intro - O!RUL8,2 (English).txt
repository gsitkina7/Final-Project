Nothing lasts forever, you only live once
So, live your life, not any other life
Take chances and never regret, never
Never be late to do what you wanna do right now
Because at one point of someday
Everything you did would be exactly what you will be, right?

My father told me to enjoy life
I want to ask my father, did you enjoy your life
I want to ask why the natural became unnatural
And why the unnatural became natural
Why am I not in my life and in some other person's life?
This is real, it's not a gamble nor a game, it's just one life
Who are you living for?
My heart stopped when I was nine or ten
Put my hand on my heart and ask what my dream was
Ah, what was it, really?
