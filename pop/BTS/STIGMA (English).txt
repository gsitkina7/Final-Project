I've been hiding it
I tell you something
Just to leave it buried
Now I can't endure it anymore
Why couldn't I say it then
I have been hurting anyway
Really, I won't be able to endure it

Now cry
It's only that I'm very sorry towards you
Again, cry
Because I couldn't protect you
Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can't reverse
Deeper, it's just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

Stop crying, tell me something
Try saying to me, who had no courage
Why did you do that to me then
I'm sorry
Forget it, what right do I have
To tell you to do this, or that

Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper
Like pieces of broken glass that I can't reverse
Deeper, it's just the heart that hurts every day
You who was punished in my stead
You who were only delicate and fragile

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, my brother
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can't be erased
"Are you calling me a sinner?"
What more do I have to say
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry my sister
Even if I try to hide it
Or conceal it, it can't be erased
So, cry, please, dry my eyes, ooh
That light, that light, please illuminate my sins (Oh)
Where I can't turn back
The red blood is flowing down
Deeper, I feel like dying every day
Please let me be punished
Please forgive me for my sins
Please
