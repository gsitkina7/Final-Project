I want to be your oppa
I'm so hungry for your love
I want to be your oppa
I'll have you, just watch

Why are you shaking up my heart?
Why are you shaking up my heart?
Why are you shaking up my heart?
Shaking up
Shaking up
(Dad) Just how exactly
Did dad ask mom out?
Should I write you a letter?
What is this? I become like dust in front of you

You make me so angry and mad for no reason
I'm serious but you make me into a loser who picks fights with you
Why do I care so much about you?
You're making a big boy act like a little kid
But, I'm going to flip the situation, from friends to lovers

If it's with you, I think I can go to a good college
ABCDEFGH Hakuna Matata
Your profile picture is the same but why do I keep checking it?
But don't misunderstand, I'm not an easy guy

I'm getting nervous, I'm getting nervous
Who are you? Are you that great?
Why do you keep teasing me?
Just stop now, hold up, hold up

Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?
Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?
Why are you shaking up my heart?
Why are you shaking up my heart?
Why are you shaking up my heart?
Shaking up
Shaking up

A bad bad girl on the outside
An even more bad bad girl on the side
If you lose a guy like me, you'll regret it
You checked my text message but you're not pressing send
The "1" disappears, making me so anxious
Maybe I'll buy a GPS navigation (Quickly quickly quickly)
I keep trying to appeal to you (trying trying trying)
Genuine feelings? (I got em) Endurance? (I got em)
The only thing I don't have is your beauty beauty beauty

How should I change for you? (hold up)
Playing mind games? Two-timing? I don't know how to do that
But if you're ever sick, don't call 911 but call me
Tell me to cry, I'll cry, tell me to smile, I'll smile, tell me to roll around, I'll roll around

I'm getting nervous, I'm getting nervous
Who are you? Are you that great?
Why do you keep teasing me?
Just stop now, hold up, hold up
Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?
Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?

I want to be your oppa
Why don't you know my heart for you?
Even if you ignore me
Even if you act cold
I can't push you out of my mind
I want to be your oppa
I will be your man, just watch
So that my heart can touch yours
I will run to you right now

Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?
Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?
