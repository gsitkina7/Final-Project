Let's go, yeah, yeah, yeah

Crackle, that ember burns up again
Swallows first before it reaches the oil
Without doubt, bound to be swept away, yeah yeah hmm
Today’s player is coming in, with the number of offenses, yeah
When it starts to bite, boom boom boom
It becomes the neighborhood drum, boom boom boom
Nudge nudge, touching me for no reason, nudge nudge, yeah
If there's no reaction, just soak it in, splish splash, yeah
The truths may become false, the lies may become true
In this place, everyone becomes someone with perfect ethics

Rage? Of course you need it
When it burns up there's always a reason
Mayhaps it’s our history
Sometimes it changes the world
But this is not rage, this is excretion
Which one is rage, you know?
Pretending it's rage and killing, real rage
Fed up, the countless number of people
You’re not just killing me (you're not)
We’re used to stepping on shit (we are)
Look at those people who've grown numb (look)
Excretion, apathy, you guys are a team, yeah


I go UGH! UGH!
I go UGH! UGH!
I’m raging at the malice-filled rage
I’m raging at the malice-filled rage
I go UGH! UGH!
I go UGH! UGH!
I’m raging at the rage that had to die out
I’m raging at the rage that had to die out (yeah yeah)


Yeah, UGH! UGH! Just go UGH! UGH!
Until it all becomes ashes, yeah, go UGH! UGH!
Yeah, UGH! UGH! Just go UGH! UGH!
Until it breaks, yeah, go UGH! UGH!
I go UGH! UGH!
I go UGH! UGH!
I’m raging at the malice-filled rage
I’m raging at the rage that had to die out, hey


This world, it is taken over by rage
It seems that nobody can live without rage
Raging, again raging, and raging
Going insane, like UGH! UGH! UGH! UGH!
There are tens of thousands of reasons to be raging
Good will and evil will, all the very same
I can rage, but if there were to be damage done
To others' lives, I don't like
That’s stop, ayy
Someone gets hurt at someone's actions
Someone becomes gloomy at someone's speech and behaviour
Someone's spur of the moment becomes someone's moment
Someone's rage becomes someone's life
Damn, ptooey

I go UGH! UGH!
I go UGH! UGH!
I’m raging at the malice-filled rage
I’m raging at the rage that had to die out, hey

Ah, what the hell is there to be upset about being criticized a bit?
You earn a lot, why are you whining again?
You'd have to put up with at least that much, ahem
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem
Y'all, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem
If I were the one told to do it, I would endure it all
Y'all, ahem, y'all, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem
If I were the one, just, ahem, a-hem, ahem


I go UGH! UGH!
I go UGH! UGH!
I’m raging at the malice-filled rage
I’m raging at the malice-filled rage
I go UGH! UGH!
I go UGH! UGH!
I’m raging at the rage that had to die out
I’m raging at the rage that had to die out (yeah yeah)


Let's go
