Burning up
Fire, fire, fire, fire

When I wake up in my room (Room), I have nothing
After the sun sets, I sway as I walk
I'm completely drunk, drunk
I'm swearing on the streets
I've lost it, I'm like a crazy guy
Everything's a mess, livin' like beep
Live however you want, it's your life anyway
Stop trying, it's okay to lose
Err'body say, la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la)
Say, la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la)
Throw your hands up, scream, burn it up

Burning up
(Ayy, ayy-oh, ayy-oh)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow
(Ayy, ayy-oh, ayy-oh)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow

Hey (Hey) burn it up (Burn it up)
Like you're gonna set everything on fire
Hey (Hey) burn it up (Burn it up)
Until the dawn is gone
It's ok to just live because we're still young
Who do you think you are to say otherwise
Stop comparing, I'm only human, so what

Live however you want, it's your life anyway
Stop trying, it's okay to lose
Err'body say, la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la)
Say, la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la)
Throw your hands up, scream, burn it up
[Chorus: SUGA, All, V]
Burning up
(Ayy, ayy-oh, ayy-oh)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow
(Ayy, ayy-oh, ayy-oh)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow

(Fire) All you with a lot of fear, come here
(Fire) All you who are suffering, come here
(Fire) Lift up your fists, all night long
(Fire) With marching footsteps
(Fire) Jump and go crazy (Ow!)

(Hot, hot, hot, hotter)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow
(Hot, hot, hot, hotter)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow
Fire, fire
(Hot, hot, hot, hotter)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow
Fire, fire
(Hot, hot, hot, hotter)
Set everything on fire, bow-wow-wow
I'll forgive you
