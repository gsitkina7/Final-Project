The moment I noticed myself
I had to leave
I had to find out
All day all night
Across the desert and the sea
This wide, wide world
I wandered, Baby I

I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
On that long road
Oh you're the light
Uninvited
Unwelcome
The only one who recognized me
This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning
Can I now hold that hand?
Ooh-ooh, I can make it right

All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right
All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right

I became a hero in this world
The loud screams that seek me out
My hand, trophy and a gold microphone
All day, everywhere
But all of this is about reaching you
It's the answer to my journey
I'm singing to find you
Baby to you

A little taller than I was before
With a voice a little more solid
All of this to go back to you
Now I'll spread wide a map called you
My rehab
Look at me, why can't you recognize me?
I don't want to hear other people's noises
Your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
Let's go back to that time
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
All those roads
Are pointing to you
Everything was useless
Anything other than you
Just touch me like that time

This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning
Now can I hold that hand?
Oh oh
I can make it right

All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right
All right
All right
Ooh, I can make it right

You are still beautiful
Just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
The reason I survived in hell
It's for you, it was not for me
If you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
I'm thirsty wandering this desert without you
So hurry and grab me quickly
I know the sea without you is the same as a desert
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right
Everything was useless
Anything other than you
Oh I can make it right

All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
