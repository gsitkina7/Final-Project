Hey, why does God always
Make us feel lonely
Oh no no no no no no
Yeah, even if we're covered in scars
We can smile if we’re together

At the end of this road you walk alone
Will you step on it, whatever there may be
Sometimes we may get tired or sick
That’s okay, I am by your side
If you and I are together
We can smile

I want to fly though I have no wings
But your hands become my wings
I want to forget the dark and lonely things
Together with you

These wings sprouted from my pain
But these wings are going towards the light
Even if it's tiring and painful, I will fly if I can
Will you hold my hand
So that I won’t be afraid anymore?
If you and I are together
I can smile

This is the path I chose
And even if they say it's fate
Because I created all of this
Even if they say it's the price
I must pay for this life

Will you walk with me?
Will you fly with me?
To the edge of the sky
So I can touch your hand
Even if it hurts like this
If you and I are together
I can smile

Ayy I never walk alone
I can feel the warmth in your hand that I’m holding
Ayy you never walk alone
Feel me, you're not alone either

Come on crawl, crawl,crawl
Crawl it, like it like that
Baby walk, walk, walk
Walk it, like it like that
Baby run, run, run
Run it, like it like that
Baby fly, fly, fly
Fly it, like it like that

This road may be long and rough but
Will you stay with me?
We may fall and sometimes get hurt but
Will you stay with me?

Ayy I never walk alone
If you and I are together, we can smile
Ayy you never walk alone
If you and I are together, we can smile
If you and I are together, we can smile
