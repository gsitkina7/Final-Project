You know those days
Those days where you're sad for no reason
Those days where your body is heavy
And it looks like everyone else except you is busy and fierce
My feet won't set off, though it seems like I'm already too late
I'm hateful of the whole world
Yeah, here and there are click-clacking speed bumps
My heart grows crumpled and my words lessen
Why the hell? I ran so hard, oh, why to me?

Come home and lie in bed
Thinking if it was my fault?
Dizzy night, looking at the clock
Soon it will be midnight

Will something be different?
It won't be something like that
But this day will be over
When the minute and second hands overlap
The world holds its breath for a little while
Zero o'clock

(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
Like that snow that just settled down
Let's breathe, like the first time
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
Turn this all around
When everything is new, zero o' clock

The beat slips away little by little
I can't put on an easy face
I keep forgetting familiar lyrics
There's nothing going my way
Yes, it's all in the past
Even talking to myself, it's not easy
Is it my fault? Is it my wrong?
Only my echo comes back with no answer

Come home and lie in bed
Thinking if it was my fault?
Dizzy night, looking at the clock
Soon it will be midnight

Will something be different?
It won't be something like that
But this day will be over
When the minute and second hands overlap
The world holds its breath for a little while
Zero o'clock

(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
Like that snow that just settled down
Let's breathe, like the first time
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
Turn this all around
When everything is new, zero o'clock

Put my hands together to pray
Hoping that tomorrow I'll laugh more, for me
It'll be better, for me
When this song ends
May a new song begin
Hoping that I'll be a little happier, yeah

(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
I hold my breath for a very brief moment
And give myself a pat today, as well
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
Turn this all around
When everything is new, zero o'clock
