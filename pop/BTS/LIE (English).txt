Tell me
With your sweet smile
Tell me
Tell me like you’re whispering in my ear
Don’t be like a prey
(Be) Smooth like a like a snake
I want to get away


(Ah woo woo)
Get away away away from me
Get away away from me
(Ah woo woo)
Whoever it may be, save me, me
Save me
It continues even when I run away
I am caught in a lie

Caught in a lie
Find the me that was pure
I can’t be free from this lie
Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell
I can’t be free from this pain
Save me, I am being punished


You want me
I’ve lost my way
You want me
Just like me every day
I feel so far away
You always come my way
It repeats all over again


(Ah woo woo)
Get away away away from me
Get away away from me
(Ah woo woo)
Whoever it may be, save me, me
Save me
It continues even when I run away
I am caught in a lie

Caught in a lie
Find the me that was pure
I can’t be free from this lie
Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell
I can’t be free from this pain
Save me, I am being punished

I am still the same person I was before
I am here, the same person I was from before, but
An overgrown lie is trying to swallow me whole

Caught in a lie
Find the me that was pure
I can’t be free from this lie
Give me back my smile
Caught in a lie
Pull me from this hell
I can’t be free from this pain
Save me, I am being punished
