The long night is following you as it flows
Time follows you and fades

Why are you getting farther away?
So far that I can’t reach you?
Tell me why, you’re so far away, why
Can’t you see me in your eyes anymore?

Love is so painful
Goodbyes are even more painful
I can’t go on if you’re not here
Love me, love me
Come back to my arms
Love is so painful
Goodbyes are even more painful
I can’t go on if you’re not here
Love me, love me
Come back to my arms

You said good bye to me
Every night before I went to bed
I hated that even more than dying
It feels like this night is the end of you and me
I don’t know you, you didn’t know me
The reason we broke up was quite simple
Now I say that
You’re like hello and goodbye
At my beginning and my end
There

Everything stopped like our red light, stop
Nothing more to say It ends with my tears, dot
I’m not okay I repeat this denial
Recite, if you can recite my mind
This is my last-ditch effort and my wish
You are my endless love and my girl

Love is so painful
Goodbyes are even more painful
I can’t go on if you’re not here
Love me, love me
Come back to my arms

I always smile at you
Even the love is a tragedy for me
I always cry after it’s over
Farewell Even though it's a comedy for you
Yes nothing is everlasting
I live without you even I feel like dying
(Hope it lasts forever girl)
Over, over, love is not over
Please take me out of this endless maze

Love is so painful
Goodbyes are even more painful
I can’t go on if you’re not here
Love me, love me
Come back to my arms

Love is so painful
Goodbyes are even more painful
I can’t go on if you’re not here
Love me, love me
Come back to my arms
Love is not over, over, over
Love is not over, over, over
Love is not over, over, over
Love is not over, over, over
