I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya
It still feels like a dream oh baby
I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya
You already know oh baby

Though I drink coffee and open my eyes
It feels like I'll fall asleep, oh no no
I imagined if I ruled the world
I would place you by my side again
Please tell me that itâ€™s not too late
If this is a nightmare, please save me
Look carefully, I'm still waiting for only you

I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya
It still feels like a dream oh baby
I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya
You already know oh baby

Oh baby love you girl
Oh beautiful girl
It still feels like a dream oh baby
Oh baby love you girl
Oh beautiful girl
Everything feels like a dream oh baby
