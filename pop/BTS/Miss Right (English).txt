You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
If I lose you, it’s a miss, right? Miss Right? (All Right)
You're my Miss Right, Miss Right
Girl you want my kiss, right? Miss Right (All Right)

Your sexy mind and your sexy body
You were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
Just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
That makes me wanna party on your body
At the end of of your long, shiny hair
Your gentle hips sing
You’re like a forest, shining inside the city
With that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
And I want you to be really really real for me
Sometimes like my mom, sometimes you’re my energy
I’m an honest guy
I’m so nice on the outside that my enemies can’t stop being honest
You’re so different from the normal people outside
That’s why you’re called the ideal type
Yeah, when I think of you, my heart grows cold
You’re my winter ocean, I want to walk by you
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies

Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you

How can a person be like this?
I start to feel like I’m the only one living in this world
You pass by my side
A sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
Even if you don’t put on makeup
You’ll put on your perfume called Attraction
I never believed that there was a god
But now you make me believe because to me, you’re a goddess
Whether you’re young or old, whether you have a hidden child
I don’t care because I love you
If I’m with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
Instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
Instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
With you, I draw out my future
In between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies
It’s you

I think she has come, I’m in front of the person who shakes up my heart
I think I’m attracted to you like a magnet, right now
Your life, your heart, your face, your line
Like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type
Oh god, I’m like the wind that is led by the weather that is you
You’re a flower, I’m a bee, I’m only going toward you

Yo
I told you many qualifications ’bout my MISS RIGHT
But why you’re my MISS RIGHT is... you are...
Just you

Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
I want to know about your day, I want to become your sighs
Yes you’re my only girl, you’re the best
You’re someone who only exists in the movies
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
Wanna walk together? Wanna walk together?
Even the weather is good, I think I’m perfect with you
You’re someone who only exists in novels
It’s you
