Welcome, first time to BTS?

Ayo, ladies and gentlemen
If you're ready, we'll sing, yeah!
Unlike the other guys
My style, my my my style, ayo!
I worked all night everyday
When you were out clubbing, yeah
Don't be surprised but listen, everyday
I got a feel, I got a feel
I'm kinda dope

We're drenched, drenched, drenched
In sweat, in our practice room
Look, my great, great, great dance moves prove it all
All the weak, loser, whiny idiots
They have nothing on me
'Cause I'm full of hope haha

Okay, we're dope from head to toe
Over half of the day, we drown in work
Even if our youth rots in the studio
Thanks to that, we're closer to success
Girls, shout louder
Make it ring, ring

I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
I am different from other guys
I don't wanna say yes, I don't wanna say yes
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night (all night)
Cause we got fire (fire!)
Higher (higher!)
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
Dope
I reject rejection
I'm always over the top
Dope, dope, dope, dope
I Reject rejection
You all work for me
Dope, dope, dope

Given up on 3? Given up on 5??
I like the number 6, how about giving up on 6?
The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks
Why are they killing us before we can even try, enemy enemy enemy
Why are you hanging your head and accepting it already? energy energy energy
Don’t ever give up, you know you not lonely
Our dawn is prettier than the day
So can I get a little bit of hope yeah
Wake your sleeping youth, go

I worked all night, every day
While you were playing in the club
I am differently from other guys
I don't wanna say yes, I don't wanna say yes
Make some noise, all right
Till your body burns up, all night (all night)
Cause we got fire (fire)
Higher, higher
I gotta make it, I gotta make it
Dope!
I reject rejection
I'm always over the top
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope, dope
I reject rejection
You all work for me
Everyone copies me
Dope, dope, dope

This is BTS Style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it fire baby
This is BTS style
Different from those lying wack jobs
Every day is hustle life
I gotta make it, I gotta make it

I'm kinda dope
Say what
Say wo, wo
Say what
Dope, dope, dope, dope
