When I was fifteen years old, I had nothing
The world was too big and I was small
Now I can’t even imagine now
I was scentless and completely empty
I pray

Love you my brother, I’ve got brothers
I discovered emotions, I became me
So I’m me
Now I’m me

You make me begin
You make me begin
You make me begin
(Smile with me, smile with me
Smile with me)
You make me begin
(Smile with me, smile with me)

I can’t take it anymore
Because you are crying
I want to cry in your place
Although I can’t

You make me begin
You make me begin
You make me begin
(Cry with me, cry with me
Cry with me)
You make me begin
(Cry with me, cry with me)

I feel like dying
When my brother is sad
When my brother is sick
It hurts more than when I’m sick

Brother let’s cry, cry, cry and get it over with
I don’t know much about sadness
But I’m gonna cry anyway
Because, because

You made me again
You made me again
You made me again
(Fly with me, fly with me
Fly with me)
You made me again
(Fly with me, fly with me)

You make me begin
You made me again
