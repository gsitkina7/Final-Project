We're now going to progress to some steps
Which are a bit more difficult
Ready, set, and begin
Bighit exclusive, exclusive

I go back every day
To me of yesterday
To the life of giving up
I let myself go away
But in this world, you know
There are truths unchanged
Time rushes ever forward
There's no ifs, buts, or maybes
Almost forgotten memories return
Touch of the devil, fateful recall
I still wonder, why did they beckon again
Every day ask me, guess it, whip it, repeat oh
Nothing that will change, so
I lock it up again, close
How much love? How much joy?
Soothe myself and stay calm, alone
Yeah, I don't care, it's all
Choices by my fate, so we're here
Look ahead, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now
(Ready, set, and begin)
That way, way, way
Wherever my way
Only Ego Ego Ego
Just trust myself

Life not of j-hope but Jeong Ho-Seok flashes by
It must have been full of regret with no hope till I die
(2 Cool, 2 Cool 4 Skool)
My dancing was chasing ghosts
Blaming my dream, asking why I live and breathe
Oh my God (God, God, God)
Uh time goes by
Seven years of anguish come out finally
Oppressions all resolved
Into my heart come answers from my most trusted
Only one hope, only one soul
Only one smile, only one you
Definite answer to the truth of the world
Only one and unchanging me, right
Now I don't care, it's all
Choices by my fate, so we're here
Look ahead, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now
(Ready, set, and begin)

That way, way, way
Wherever my way
Only Ego Ego Ego
Just trust myself

Way I trust, way I go (That way, way, way)
Became my fate, became my core (Wherever my way)
Hard it was, and sad it was (Only ego, ego, ego)
Still reassured and made me know myself (Just trust myself)
Map of the Soul, map of the all (Map of the Soul)
That's my ego, that's my ego
Map of the Soul, map of the all
That's my ego, that's my ego (Map of the Soul)
