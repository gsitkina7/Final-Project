24, feels like I became a grown-up faster than everyone else
My life has been a movie, all the time
I ran to where the sun rises every single night
It's like I've been to someone's tomorrow
The boy who found the world too big
Keep on runnin' errday, pick the mic up
Friends ridin' subway, I'll be in the airplane mode
All over the world rock on, I made my own lotto
But is it too fast? There are traces of losses
Don't know what to do with, am I livin' this right?
Why am I alone in a different time and space?
Oh, I can't call ya, I can't hol' ya
Oh, I can't
And yes you know, yes you know
Oh, I can't call ya, I can't touch ya
Oh, I can't
Let me know

Can I someday finna find my time? (Yeah, finna find my time)
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my time

Oh, I think I was in yesterday
'Cause everybody walk too fast
I'm a little kid grown up not knowing it (Like a child who got lost)
This got me oh just trippin’
It feels I'm roaming over
Don't know what to do with, am I livin' this right?
Why am I alone in a different time and space?

Oh, I can't call ya, I can't hol' ya
Oh, I can't
And yes you know, yes you know
Oh, I can't call ya, I can't touch ya
Oh, I can't
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time? (Yeah, finna find my time)
Finna find my time (Yeah)
Someday finna find my time (Oh, yeah)

Sometimes when I'm gasping for air
I wear my hat low and keep running
Yeah, I don't gotta know where I go
Even if it's opposite of sun
One time for the present
Two time for the past
Happy that we met each other
Now 'til the very end

Oh, I will call ya, I will hol' ya
Oh I will
And yes you know, yes you know
Oh, I will call ya, I will touch ya
Oh, I will
And you know

Can I someday finna find my time? (Yeah)
Can I someday finna find my time?
Finna find my time (Yeah, oh, yeah)
Find my time (Someday finna find my time)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
