Success and happiness look alike but they're different (Different, different, ah)
But I want a bigger success
More wealth and even greater fame
I want thе money to chase me
But I hopе I don't become a monster chasing only money
I pray
I tell myself I won't hope for other's failure
My family, fan, and the team are my top priorities
Yeah, let's make money
My grand ambition is quite high
The world is yours
Now the entire world is god damn in my hand

The kid who danced in Busan

Now world is ours
That's true, that's true
Started from AX, Gymnastics Hall
Look carefully, this is my area

The major you all used to curse at
I'm still an idol
The result is three Billboards
That's true
