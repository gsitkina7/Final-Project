If I die, I'll probably go to hell because I lie to more than a dozen times a day, uh
The ethics book never taught how the heart can become more truthful
That's why I can't be honest
In a way, I might be your stalker, or maybe your investigator
My heart is a precious jewel
This kind of heart was supposed to be stolen by you anyway
Will our relationship perhaps become a period after putting in a comma
Even if I forget you and rip you apart and wash you
It still won't work, it's all just in my mind
I want to invite you
My lady, welcome to my world
It's just onе phrase
But it won't leave my lips
I sing likе myself when I am beside you, want it
Whenever I run into you (Ah-ah)
Whenever I think of you (Ooh)
I always like this (like this) whisper to myself like this (like this)
If anyone is listening right now, please put a quotation mark here
So that I can confess everything, so you can hear it (hear it) oh, baby

Ever since the day I met you, I was full of regrets, and I was so angry at what I couldn't say (Ah-ah)
My feelings are not a box, so why do I keep closing it?
At night I kick off my blanket, turning into a devil that wants to have you
When will it be? I'll keep fighting with myself
Today, I'll cast my heart away before I unwind in your booth
I hope so, and I move on, but when I stand in front of you, I lose
I want you so badly, please, it's already my wish, oh, my genie, huh
Do she love me? Do, do she love me?
Not this fear from cold froze my lips
I emphasize the exclamation mark, now it's nothing but a question mark of doubt, but a word filled with sincerity
Courage is a double quote, I want it, ha, ha

Whenever I run into you (Ah-ah)
Whenever I think of you (Ooh)
I always like this (like this) whisper to myself like this (like this)
If anyone is listening right now, please put a quotation mark here
So that I can confess everything, so you can hear it (hear it) oh, baby
