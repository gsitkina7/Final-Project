That long night seems to be only flowing as it follows you
This time seems to be fading as it follows you

Why are you getting farther away?
So far that I can’t reach you?
Tell me why, you’re so far away, why
Can’t you see me in your eyes anymore?

Love is painful, something painful yeah
It seems that goodbyes are painful, something more painful
[Post-Hook: Jin, Jimin, Jungkook]
Without you, I don't think I can be
Love me, love me
Come back to my arms

Love is painful, something painful yeah
It seems that goodbyes are painful, something more painful

Without you, I don't think I can be
Love me, love me
Come back to my arms

Love is not over, over, over
Love is not over, over, over
Love is not over, over, over
Love is not over, over, over

Love is painful, something painful yeah
It seems that goodbyes are painful, something more painful
