We're here, the fun boys
Here, here, the fun boys
We're here, the fun boys
Fun, fun
I don't even know myself

We're here, the fun boys
Here, here, the fun boys
We're here, the fun boys
Fun, fun (It's B-T-S)
The fun boys go until the dawn moon sets
This is so fun, all fakeness has gone home
So even if you’re tone-deaf or rhythm-deaf
It doesn’t matter, throw your timidness away
We’re having fun, fun, fun, fun
Come gather here, I see your shoulder dance
Let's ride go with me, I see the peak over there
Add on another prize to my days, I'm becoming weird
You can't go to the peak by being normal, baby
Fun, fun, forget the engine
Fun, fun, speed on fast
Look at me, I'm gonna go crazy today, don't stop me
Leave, leave, if you don’t wanna, just go home

The moment the music flows
I think I'll go crazy, hey
You're gonna be shaken by my body
Right now in this moment

Don't ask me, I was always like this
I don't even know myself, I’m me from start to finish (Sing it!)
Wo wo wo wo
(One more time, now!)
Wo wo wo wo
We're here, the fun boys
Here, here, the fun boys
We're here, the fun boys
Fun, fun
I don't even know myself

My fatal body movement, my insanity is crazy
I wanna do everything my way, so don't touch me
Though I'm the oldest, no, no, no
Though they play with me, no, no, no
Well, who cares (Who cares)
I'm fine (Fine)
I'm satisfied, okay (Okay!)
Yo, my name is V
I set the tone for the competition

Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop (Oh, I'm sorry)
Take your pick, take your pick, Hoshik, take your pick
If hope is with us, we won't know time is passing
Let's wash ourselves with sweat, chikichakacho
Today, I'm it, meeny, miny, moe
Stop saying nonsense, you're draining my energy
Don't even think about talking behind my back, I’m quick
I'll bite you with my teeth, bleed you dry
Did you eat? In Chinese, don't get drunk?
The moment the music flows
I think I'll go crazy, hey
You're gonna be shaken by my body
Right now in this moment

Don't ask me, I was always like this
I don't even know myself, I’m me from start to finish (Sing it!)
Wo wo wo wo
(One more time, now!)
Wo wo wo wo
(Break it down!)

All you fun people gather here
Gather here
Any other fun people?
Get behind me
All you fun people gather here
Gather here
Any other fun people?
Get behind me

Don't ask me, I was always like this
I don't even know myself, I'm me from start to finish (Sing it!)
Wo wo wo wo
(One more time, now!)
Wo wo wo wo
(Break it down!)

We're here, the fun boys
Here, here, the fun boys
We're here, the fun boys
Fun, fun
I don't even know myself
