Wherever you live
Wherever I live

I ran for a long time
I ran again for a long time
Yeah I’ll be ridin' and I’ll be dyin’
In ma city

I don’t know what to say
Even if I die, I can’t tell
Even if you give me a hundred thousand dollars to live somewhere else
Ah, no thanks
Ilsan is where I want to be buried even after I die
It’s the city of the flower, city of Mon
La Festa and the Western Dom that are like home
The Hugok Academy that raised me during my young years, uh
The most harmonious place in the world, uh
Nature and the city’s building and flowers, uh
Me, who likes the Ilsan Lake Park more than the Han River
Will hug you much more warmly, even though we’re small
When I feel like I’m forgetting myself
In that place, I find my old self
(I) remember everything, even your smell
You’re my summer autumn
Winter and every spring
The Busan beach there
Say la la la la la
Under the blue sky, this skyline
Say la la la la la
Ahjaedeul, put your hands up
Ahjimae too, wave your hands
Come to ma city

Come to ma city
I hope that you’ll watch over me well
Know how to party
The city that raised me
That’s right, baby baby
This is my city city
Welcome to ma city

I ran for a long time
I ran again for a long time
Yeah I'll be ridin' and I'll be dyin’
In ma city, city
Ma city, ma city, yeah

I’m a South Jeollado, Gwangju's baby
Even if my footsteps go to the mountains
It always goes to the summit of Mt. Mudeung, every day
My life is hot, the heat of the south
There’s no such thing as giving up on the law of this fierce heat
I put on a KIA and I turn on the engine
Bounce like crazy
With just one dance I raise my big dream of being a singer
Now in front of reality (I do) music and I jump on stage
Everyone saw, right? I put in passion
I’m Gwangju’s hoshigi, the country’s 8 provinces gear up
If you want to see me then gather at 7
Everyone dial it, 062 - 518
The Busan beach there
Say la la la la la
Under the blue sky, this skyline
Say la la la la la
Ahjaedeul, put your hands up
Ahjimae too, wave your hands
Come to ma city

Come to ma city
I hope that you’ll watch over me well
Know how to party
The city that raised me
That’s right, baby baby
This is my city city
Welcome to ma city

I was born in Daegu, I was brought up in Daegu
It’s a bit difficult to get a blood transfusion
My blue blood inside my body
This bastard in every album
Talks about Daegu
And doesn’t seem to get bored of it
You can think like that but
I’m a D-boy, that’s right I’m a D-boy
Honestly speaking, in Daegu
There’s nothing much to boast about
My birth is in itself, Daegu’s pride
Right? Ah alright
There’s nothing to boast
But I can’t help but be proud, right?
Ayo, I’m the most successful guy born in Daegu
You will hear this kind of thing, listen well now
I’m Daegu’s pride, a new generation, a new wind
Daegu’s past, present, and future
Come to ma city
I hope that you’ll watch over me well
Know how to party
The city that raised me
That’s right, baby baby
This is my city city
Welcome to ma city

I ran for a long time
I ran again for a long time
Yeah I'll be ridin' and I'll be dyin’
In ma city, city
Ma city, ma city, yeah

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Wherever I live, wherever I am
Ma city, city
Ma city, ma city, yeah yeah
