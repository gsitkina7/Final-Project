Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

Girl, I debuted, that’s enough right?
I made a bet with the world on how much I’d succeed
My half-moon eye smile that I only showed you
I’m doing it again these days
My fans are curious
Oh and I don’t drink macchiatos
You know that I started drinking americanos because of you
When we dated, I wondered what kind of taste this was
But this cold and bitter aftertaste
Makes sense now that you’re not here girl
If I’m gonna get used to everything like this
I would choose the full-of-regrets, playing with fire
Our heartless promises
Countless mistakes and other wrongs
Our unspeakable and small wounds
The glass filled with memories is more bitter as I drink it
But I think I know why I keep drinking it
Why am I getting so sad that everyone lives this way?
Oh oh oh

Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah yeah yeah

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

Baby tonight, have a good night
Our first text and phone call that
Was filled with awkward moments
Our highly anticipated first date
Why did I bite my nails? Why was I so nervous?
As time went by, we naturally developed into lovers
With those kinds of words
We checked each other’s feelings
Our first date was sweet like a caramel macchiato
Wherever we went, we wanted to go together
But as time went by
Those feelings went down like dripping down espresso
Uh, my insides ache for no reason, uh we used to be so good
Breaking up was like a bitter americano
My memories still go to that cafe

Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight
Yeah

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight

1,2,3,4
The days when I used to be
Intoxicated with your scent all day
I remember we chose to break up
After promising our futures together
As I drink this minty coffee that you
Used to like, I think of you, rewind
A lot of time passed and these days
I sometimes miss you, I wonder why?

Baby baby, you’re a caramel macchiato
Your scent is still sweet on my lips
Baby baby tonight

Baby baby, you were warmer than the scent of a cafe latte
Do you remember that feeling?
Baby baby tonight
