Am I wrong, fallin' in love with you
Tell me am I wrong
While your other man was out there
Cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you

The world’s goin’ crazy
How about you how bout ya
You think it is okay
I don’t think it’s that okay
Have ears but don’t listen
Have eyes but don’t see
Fish live in all our hearts
Its name is selfish, selfish
We’re all dogs, pigs, become dogs because we’re angry
Stork VS crow-tit warring errday
Crazy world yeah
Makes us crazy yeah
That’s right we’re all crazy
All right now give a shout
MAYDAY MAYDAY

It seems like the entire world has gone crazy
Seems like the end
Oh why Oh why
Oh why Oh why
Oh why why why why
OH MY GOD

Am I Wrong
Did I say something wrong?
Did I lie?
Going crazy (Gone crazy gone crazy)
Crazy (gone crazy gone crazy)
Am I Wrong
Am I Wrong
Where am I going
The world’s going crazy

Are you ready for this
Are you ready for this
Are you ready for this
No, I'm not

That’s right kid you gone crazy
The fact that you’re not crazy in a crazy world is crazy
The earth and sky and all around (HELL YEAH)
Online offline (HELL YEAH)

If what you see on the news is nothing to you
If that comment is nothing to you
If that hatred is nothing to you
You’re not normal, you’re abnormal

It seems like the entire world has gone crazy
Seems like the end
Oh why Oh why
Oh why Oh why
Oh why why why why
OH MY GOD

Am I Wrong
Did I say something wrong?
Am I Wrong
Did I lie?
Going crazy (gone crazy gone crazy)
Crazy (gone crazy gone crazy)
Am I Wrong (Am I Wrong)
Am I Wrong (Am I Wrong)
Where am I going
The world’s going crazy

Though I walk this crazy world’s path
I still want to live longer
I want to find it, my faith

Am I Wrong
Did I say something wrong?
Did I lie?
Going crazy (Gone crazy gone crazy)
Crazy (gone crazy gone crazy)
Am I Wrong
Am I Wrong
Where am I going
The world’s going crazy

Are you ready for this
Are you ready for this
Are you ready for this
