Was it honestly the best?
'Cause I just wanna see the next
Diligently passing through
All our yesterdays so beautifully
Yeah, the past was honestly the best
But my best is what comes next
I'm not playin', nah for sure
Heading towards the day 'till I get winded
You and I, best moment is yet to come
Moment is yet to come, yeah
Not sure since when
But they say we're the best
Full of these unfamiliar names
Now they just feel heavy
We just loved music
We're just running forward
Promise that we'll keep on comin' back for more

Somewhere deep inside your heart
There still lives a young boy
My-y-y-y moment is yet to come
Yet to come

Uh, do you have a dream, what's at the end of that path?
Moment is yet to come, yeah
Uh, in the hush of night, we won't stop moving
Yet to come
*Uh, we gonna touch the sky, 'fore the day we die*
**Moment is yet to come, yeah**
*Uh, this is only the beginning, the best yet to come*

That uncomfortable title we were given one day
We are still abashed by being called the best
You know, I, I just love music
Nothing much has changed from back then
If nothing much has changed, probably
You'll say it's all a lie, yeah
There were a lot of changes but
I'm still the same, a new chapter
Every moment is my new best
Like I'm thirteen years old again
Spittin' bars just like I did back then, huh
Still got a lot to learn
My life, got a lot to fulfill
If you're askin' me why
My heart's tellin' you
We ain't about it
The world's expectations
We ain't about it
That step of being the best
We ain't about it
Crowns and flowers, countless trophies
We ain't about it
Dream and hope, and goin' forward
We so about it
It's back to square one after making one long turn, back to one

Somewhere deep inside your heart
There still lives a young boy
My-y-y-y moment is yet to come
Yet to come

Uh, do you have a dream? What's at the end of that path?
Moment is yet to come, yeah
Uh, in the hush of night, we won't stop moving
Yet to come
*Uh, we gonna touch the sky, 'fore the day we die*
**Moment is yet to come, yeah**
*Uh, this is only the beginning, the best yet to come*
So was it honestly the best? (The best)
'Cause I just wanna see the next ('Cause I just wanna see the next, yeah)
Dazzlingly passing
Through the memories (Through) so beautifully (Beautifully)
Yeah, the past was honestly the best (The best)
But my best is what comes next (But my best is what comes next, yeah)
We'll be singin' till the morn
Heading towards (Towards) the day more like ourselves (Like)
You and I, best moment is yet to come
