At first sight, I could recognize you (Hmm-mm)
As if we were calling for each other (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
The DNA in my blood vessels tell me (Hmm-mm)
That it's you I was looking all over for (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Our meeting is like a mathematical formula
Commandments of religion, providence of the universe
The evidence of destiny given to me
You're the source of my dream, take it, take it
My hand reaching out to you is my chosen fate

Don't worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We're totally different, baby
Because we're the two who found our destiny

From the day of the universe's creation and beyond (beyond)
Through the infinite centuries and beyond (beyond, beyond, yah)
In the previous life (In the previous life)
Maybe the next too (Maybe the next too)
We're eternally together

(DNA)
None of this is a coincidence
(DNA)
Because we're the two who found our destiny
(DNA)

I want it, this love (This love), I-I want it, real love (Real love)
I only focus on you, you steer me a little harder
The DNA (DNA) of the genesis wants you
This is inevitable, I love us (Love us)
We are the only true lovers (Lovers)
Every time I see her, I freak out
Surprisingly, I keep gasping and it's weird, maybe
This is the emotion they call love (Oh, yeah)
Because from the very beginning, my heart runs to you

Don't worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We're totally different, baby
Because we're the two who found our destiny

From the day of the universe's creation and beyond (beyond)
Through the infinite centuries and beyond (beyond, beyond, yah)
In the previous life (In the previous life)
Maybe the next too (Maybe the next too)
We're eternally together

(DNA)
None of this is a coincidence
(DNA)
Because we're the two who found our destiny
(DNA)

Don't look back
Because we're the two who found our destiny
Don't regret it, baby
Because we're
Forever, forever, forever
Forever, (forever), we are together

Don't worry, love (Oh-oh-oh)
None of this is a coincidence
We're totally different, baby
Because we're the two who found our destiny

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Because it's not a coincidence, DNA
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Because it's not a coincidence, DNA
