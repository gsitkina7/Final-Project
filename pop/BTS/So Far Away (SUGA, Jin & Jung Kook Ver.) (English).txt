It sucks when you don't have anything you want to do (You don't have)
I know it's pathetic to not have something as common as a dream, I know
"You said to do as I'm told, that it would all be fine when I go to university"
I'm the asshole for believing those words
I live because I can't die

Give me some drinks (Give me some drinks)
I want to get drunk today
Please don't stop me
Anything will be fine, (Anything will be fine) alcohol is a luxury for a bitch
I can't stand being sober (Ay)
Everyone else is running, why am I the only one here (Ay)
Everyone else is running, why am I the only one here (Ay)
Everyone else is running, why am I the only one here
[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
So far away, if I have a dream
If I have a dream that flies away
Don’t fall away, yea, if I have a dream
If I have a dream that flies away, oh, oh, oh

Dream, I will be there for your creation until the end of your life (Ouu-uu-u)
Dream, wherever you might be, it will be lenient (Aa-ah-ahh)
Dream, you will fully bloom after all the hardships (Fully bloom)
Dream, though your beginnings may be humble, may the end be prosperous

Yeah, fuck, I live because I can't die (Live)
Nothing is more miserable and lonely than not having something you want to do (Something)
The only thing everyone around me says
Is to come to my senses
I try to vent out my anger but the only one here with me is me
So what’s the point of venting?
Every morning, it's terrifying to open my eyes,(It's terrifying) to breath

My friends, even my family are getting further away (Ay)
As time goes by, I'm becoming more impatient (Ay)
The feeling of being on my own
I am on my own right now, I want everything to disappear
I want it to disappear like a mirage
Want it to disappear
I want my damn self to disappear
Like this, the world throws me away (Ay)
In that moment I'm getting farther away from the sky
I’m falling (I’m falling)
[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
So far away, if I have a dream
If I have a dream that flies away
Don’t fall away, if I have a dream
If I have a dream that flies away, oh, oh, oh

Dream, (Oh, oh, oh) I will be there for your creation until the end of your life (Oh, oh, oh)
Dream, wherever you might be, it will be lenient (So far away)
Dream, you will fully bloom after all the hardships (Ahh-ah-ahhh-hm)
Dream, though your beginnings may be humble, may the end be prosperous

So far away, if I have a dream (So far away)
If I have a dream that flies away
Don’t fall away, if I have a dream
If I have a dream that flies away, oh, oh, oh

Dream, I will be there for your creation until the end of your life
Dream, wherever you might be, it will be lenient
Dream, you will fully bloom after all the hardships
Dream, though your beginnings may be humble, may the end be prosperous

I will be there for your creation until the end of your life (First love)
Wherever you might be, it will be lenient
First love
You will fully bloom after all the hardships
Though your beginnings may be humble, may the end be prosperous
So far away
First love
So far away
First love
So far away
First love
So far away
First love
So far away
Don’t fall away
So far away
Don’t fall away
