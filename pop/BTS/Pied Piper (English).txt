It's dangerous so it's better
You know deep inside
You can't stop it now (You can't stop)
So be honest with me now
Stop, now stop watching and study for your test
Your parents and boss hate me
Video clips, pictures, tweets
V app, Bon Voyage
I know, you can't help what you like
But stop, interpret the music video later
You have so many pictures of me in your room anyway
It's not just one hour, it's a whole year that'll disappear
So this song is a reward I'm giving to you

You're not being punished
Come here, I'm your paradise
Can't close your eyes (Can't close your eyes)
You can throw a fit but it's no use (Don't reject me)
Just close your eyes, tune your ears

Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this song
It's a bit dangerous but I'm so sweet
I'm here to save you, I'm here to ruin you
You called me, see? I'm so sweet
Follow the sound of the pipe
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I'm takin' over you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I'm takin' over you)

You know that it's already begun
The moment you hear that sound (Yeah, SUGA)
Maybe I'm a bit dangerous
Like the pied piper
I'm testing you
Like the fruit from the tree of good and evil
My pipe awakens everything
That sound burns you up even more
You're pulled by it, you react
I'm endlessly blowing
I'm your guilty pleasure
You can't escape, never
You're not being punished
Come here, I'm your paradise
Can't close your eyes (Can't close your eyes)
You can throw a fit but it's no use (Don't reject me)
Just close your eyes, tune your ears

Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this song
It's a bit dangerous but I'm so sweet
I'm here to save you, I'm here to ruin you
You called me, see? I'm so sweet
Follow the sound of the pipe

Yeah, I'm a bit dangerous (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can't even handle myself (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Don't worry, my hands
They're only warm for you
If I'm ruining you right now (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Please forgive me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Because I can't live without you
Because you know all of this

Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I'm takin' over you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I'm takin' over you)
