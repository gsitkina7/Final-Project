(Yeah yeah)
Is this love
Is this love
Sometimes I know
Sometimes I don't
The next lyrics, um
What should I write, um
Too many words circle around me
But none of them feel how I feel
I just feel it
Like the moon rises after the sun rises
Like how fingernails grow
Like trees that shed their bark once a year
That you are the one who will give meaning to my memories
Who will make a 'person' into 'love'
Before I knew you
My heart was filled with straight lines only
I'm just a human, human, human
You erode all my corners
And make me into love, love, love
We're humans, humans, humans
In that myriad of straight lines
My love, love, love
When you sit on top of it and you become my heart

I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(Live & love, live & love)
I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(If it's love, I will love you)

You make I to an O
I to an O
Because of you
I know why human and love sound similar
You make live to a love
Live to a love
Because of you
I know why a person should live by love
It's a long way from I to U
Fuck, JKLMNOPQRST
I crossed all the letters and I reached you
Look, mine and yours also sound the same
Though that doesn't make me you
I want to be part of your bookcase
I'd like to be involved in your novel
As a lover
I'm just a human, human, human
You erode all my edges
And make me into love, love, love
We're humans, humans, humans
In that myriad of straight lines
My love, love, love
Sit on top of it and it becomes a heart

I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(Live & love, live & love)
I live so I love
I live so I love
(Live & love, live & love)
(If it's love, I will love you)

What if I go?
If I go, would you be sad?
If I wasn't me, what would I be?
Do you think you'll leave me after all?

Wind, wind, wind blowing by
(I just hope not)
People, people, people that will pass by
(I just hope not)
My mood is blue, blue, blue
(In my head, it's blue from top to bottom)
How much I love you
How much, much, much
You're my person, my person, my person
You're my desire, my desire, my desire
You're my pride, my pride, my pride
You're my love (my love)
One and only love (only love)

You're my person, my person, my person
You're my desire, my desire, my desire
You're my pride, my pride, my pride
You're my love (my love)
One and only love (only love)

You know...
We were always meant to be...
Destiny...
I hope you feel the same with me...
LOVE
