Dollar dollar
Squandering it all in one day
Run, run, I make and waste my own money
Run, run, run, run
Run, run (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

I want to be cruisin' on the bay
I want to be cruisin' like Nemo
No money but I wanna go far away
I don't have money but I wanna relax
No money but I wanna eat Jiro Ono's sushi (Swish)
Worked hard to get my pay, yeah
Gonna spend it all on my stomach
Pinching pennies to spend it all on wasting it
Leave me be, even if I overspend
Even if I break apart my savings tomorrow
Like a crazy guy (Woo, woo)

Ooh, there's no tomorrow
There's already a mortgage on my future (Mortgage)
Ooh, spending my money even more
Friends, what's up?
Do you want some? (Want some?)

Dollar, dollar
Squandering it all in one day
Run, run, man, I spend it like some party
Dollar, dollar
Till the sun shines through this mouse hole
Till the sun comes up

YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo
YOLO YOLO, yo
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun
(Squandering fun, squandering fun)
YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo (Yo)
Where my money yah
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun
YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo
YOLO YOLO, yo
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun (Woo, woo, woo)
YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo (Ta)
Where the party yah
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun
Where my money? Yah (Woo)
Where the party? Yah (Woo)
My week goes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, gold gold gold gold
My bank account is a pot with no bottom, yah (Woo)
Every day, I'm pouring water into it (Woo)
Just break it apart
We're too young to just worry
For today, just go instead of worrying
If you get scared and say you're saving, it becomes poop
So rub it all around

Dollar, dollar
Squandering it all in one day
Run, run, man, I spend it like some party
Dollar, dollar
Till the sun shines through this mouse hole
Till the sun comes up

YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo
YOLO YOLO, yo
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun
(Squandering fun, squandering fun)
YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo (Yo)
Where my money yah
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun
YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo
YOLO YOLO, yo
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun (Woo, woo, woo)
YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, yo (Ta)
Where the party yah
Squandering fun, squandering fun, squandering fun
