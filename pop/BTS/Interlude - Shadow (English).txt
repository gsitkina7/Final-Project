I wanna be a rap star
I wanna be the top
I wanna be a rockstar
I want it all mine
I wanna be rich
I wanna be the king
I wanna go win
I wanna be
I wanna be a rap star
I wanna be the top
I wanna be a rockstar
I want it all mine
I wanna be rich
I wanna be the king
I wanna be me
I want a big thing
Oh boy let me see
I got a big dream yeah

Ooh, I wondered everyday how far I'd go
I came to my senses and I find myself here
Yeah, hmm, shadow at my feet
Look down, it's gotten even bigger
I run but the shadow follows, as dark as the light's intense
I'm afraid, flying high is terrifying
No one told me how lonely it is up here
I can leap in the air but also plunge, now I know
Running away could be an option too, pause

People say, there's splendor in that bright light
But my growing shadow swallows me and becomes a monster
Up high, high, and higher, higher
I only go higher and vertigo overtakes me
I rise, rise, I hate it
I pray, I pray, hoping to be okay

The moment I'm flying high as I wished
My shadow grows in that blasting stark light
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm afraid
The moment I face myself brought lowest
It so happens that I'm flying the highest
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm scared
Don't let me shine

Try smiling, what are you hesitating for?
Wasn't this the kind of thing you were hoping for?
Or cry instead, what are you scared of?
Wasn't this the kind of thing you'd been wanting?
The life you hoped for, the life you wanted
The life you chose, you achieved everything without regrets
And on top of that, you have a big house, big cars, big rings
All the things you wanted, you've got it all
So what's the problem? Just enjoy it
Or just let it go, no? Then run, or stop
Don't whine, just choose one or the other

You're saying I never told you that? (Yeah, yeah)
You're asking me if I really didn't know? (Oh no)
I'll simply take just as much as you own, whatever it is
That at times, your rest becomes your fall
Do you finally get it? That giving it your best effort every time is what it means to do your best

The moment I'm flying high as I wished
My shadow grows in that blasting stark light
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm afraid
The moment I face myself brought lowest
It so happens that I'm flying the highest
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm scared
Don't let me shine

I wanna be a rap star
I wanna be the top
I wanna be a rockstar
I want it all mine
I wanna be rich
I wanna be the king
I wanna go win
I wanna be

I wanna be a rap star
I wanna be the top
I wanna be a rockstar
I want it all mine
I wanna be rich
I wanna be the king
I wanna be me
I wanna be â€¦

Yeah I'm you, you are me, now do you know
Yeah you are me, I'm you, now you do know
We are one body, sometimes we will clash
You can never break me off, this you must know
Yeah yeah can't break me off, whatever you do
Yeah you'll be at ease if you admit it too
Yeah succeed or fail, whichever way you flow
Yeah you can't escape, wherever you go

I am you, you are me, now you do know
You are me, I am you, now do you know
We are one body and we are gonna clash
We are you, we are me, this do you know
