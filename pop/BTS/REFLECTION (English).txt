I know
Every life’s a movie
We got different stars and stories
We got different nights and mornings
Our scenarios ain’t just boring
I find this movie very amusing
Everyday, I want to shoot it well
I want to caress myself
I want to caress myself
But you know, sometimes
I really really hate myself
To be honest, quite often
I really hate myself
When I really hate myself, I go to Dduksum
I just stand there with the familiar darkness
With the people that are smiling
And beer, which makes me smile
Coming to me softly
Fear, which holds my hand
It’s okay because everyone is in twos or threes
It’s good that I have a friend, too

The world is just another name for despair
My height is just another diameter for the earth
I am all of my joy and anxiety
It repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
Hey you, who’s looking over the Han River
If we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
Or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
Maybe we bumped into each other countless times
In the darkness
People look happier than the day
Everyone else knows where they’re supposed to be
But only I walk without purpose
But still, blending in with them is more comfortable
Dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
Hands me an entirely different world
I want to be free
I want to be free from freedom
Because right now I’m happy but I’m unhappy
I’m looking at myself
At Dduksum

I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
I wish I could love myself
