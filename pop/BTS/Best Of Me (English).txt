When you say that you love me
I walk above the clouds
Tell me about eternity just one more time
When you say that you love me
All I need is that one phrase
That you'll never change, just one more time
You're like the whole world to me
Hug me harder and more painfully
That something that we shared
And you can't make it nothing (Nothing)
I hope you don't forget that you're my

Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don't leave me
You got the best of me

Even though I haven't seen my limits
But if it exists, It's probably you
I wanted to be the tender waves
But why didn't I know you were the sea?
What do I do?
I speak with your language
And I breathe in your air
I'll be you, I'll be in your grasp
As I kiss your sword
So take my hand right now
I don't believe that I'm like this
The words I've said to myself a million times
Please don't leave me, ooh-woah
You got the best of me, you got the best of me
It's not important if it's a dream or reality
Only the fact that you're by my side (Thanks)

Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you may be unaware

You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

You're my savior, you're my window
All I need is you (You got the best of me)
I need you (So, please just don't leave me)
You got the best of me

I used to rain
I used to snow
I stop all the misfortune
And I bring the heavens
Don't speak of it so lightly
There's no me without you
You're the best of me, the best of me, yeah

You just give me the confidence within myself (Oh, yeah)
That's all I wanted (Woo, woo)
There may not be rules between us
But the way to love exists
Who got the best of me? (Best of me) Who got the best of me?
No one knows, but I know me
You are my best master (Oh)

You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
You got the best of me

You're my savior, you're my window
All I need is you (You got the best of me)
I need you (So, please just don't leave me)
You got the best of me

When you say that you love me
I walk above the clouds
Tell me of eternity, just one more time
When you say that you love me
All I need is that one phrase
That you'll never change, just one more time
