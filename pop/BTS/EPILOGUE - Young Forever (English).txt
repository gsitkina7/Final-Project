The curtain falls and I’m out of breath
I get mixed feelings as I breathe out
Did I make any mistakes today?
How did the audience seem?
I’m happy with who I’ve become
That I can make someone scream with joy
Still excited from the performance

I stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long
While standing on this empty stage, I become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness
Within my suffocating feelings
On top of my life’s line
Without a reason, I forcibly act that I am fine
This isn’t the first time, I better get used to it
I try to hide it, but I can’t
When the heat of the show cools down
I leave the empty seats behind

Trying to comfort myself
I tell myself the world can’t be perfect
I start to let myself go
The thundering applause, I can’t own it forever
I tell myself, so shameless
Raise your voice higher
Even if the attention isn’t forever, I’ll keep singing
As today’s me, I want eternity
Forever, I want to be young

Forever we are young

Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

Forever we are young

Even when I fall and hurt myself
I endlessly run toward my dream

Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

Forever ever ever ever
We are young

Forever ever ever ever
(dreams, hopes, forward, forward)

Forever ever ever ever
We are young

Forever we are young

Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

Forever we are young

Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream

Forever we are young
Under the flower petals raining down
I run, so lost in this maze

Forever we are young
Even when I fall and hurt myself
I keep running toward my dream
