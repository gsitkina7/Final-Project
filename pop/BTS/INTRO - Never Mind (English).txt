I only look forward and run
Without having time to look around
Without me noticing, I have become the pride of my family
And I have succeeded to some extent
They say teenage years mess you up
I think of it suddenly
At that time I was young
And had nothing to fear
A few times defeated isn’t much
If there’s anything that’s different it’s my height
And also being a bit more mature for my age
From the underground workplace in NamSanDong
My beat has been laid out until Apgujeong
The origin of youth
Everyone said it, don’t go overboard
If you act as if you’re a know-it-all and will be making music
You will make your home go broke
From that point onwards, I didn’t care
No matter what anyone said
I only lived how I wanted, guided by only my beliefs
In your eyes, how do you think I’m doing right now
How do you think I am
I want to ask the several people who prayed for me to screw up
Does it seem like my home is going broke, you bastards?

I don’t give a shit I don’t give a fuck
Like I always said hundreds of time every day, “Never mind me”
I can have a taste of failure and frustration and bow my head
We are still young and immature, don’t even worry about it
Moss surely grows on a stone that doesn’t roll
If you can’t return, go straight through your mistakes and forget them all
Never mind
It’s not easy but engrave it onto your chest
If you feel like you’re going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
Come on

Never mind, never mind
No matter how thorny the road is, run

Never mind, never mind
There are lots of things in the world that you can’t help
You better

Never mind, never mind
If you feel like you’re going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
Never mind, never mind
We’re too young and immature to give up, you idiot
Never mind

If you feel like you’re going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
If you feel like you’re going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
Never mind
