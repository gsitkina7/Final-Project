A sound of something breaking
I awake from sleep
A sound full of unfamiliarity
Try to cover my ears but can’t go to sleep

The pain in my throat gets worse
Try to cover it
I don’t have a voice
Today I hear that sound again

It’s ringing again, that sound
A crack again on this frozen lake
I dumped myself into the lake
I buried my voice for you

Over the winter lake I was thrown
A thick ice has formed atop
A winter lake on which I was thrown away
A thick ice has formed
In the dream I shortly went into
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same

Have I lost myself
Or have I gained you
I suddenly run to the lake
There’s my face in it

Please don't say anything
Reach my hand out to cover the mouth
But in the end, spring will come someday
The ice will melt and flow away

Tell me if my voice isn't real
If I shouldn’t have thrown myself away
Tell me if even this pain isn’t real
What I was supposed to do back then
