I'm opening my eyes in the darkness
When my heartbeat sounds unfamiliar
I'm looking at you in the mirror
The fear-ridden eyes, asking the question

(SUGA) Loving myself might be harder
Than loving someone else, let's admit it
The standards you made are more strict for yourself
The thick tree rings in your life
It's part of you, it's you
Now let's forgive ourselves
Our lives are long, trust yourself when in a maze
When winter passes, spring always comes

From the eyes of the cold night
I try to hide myself
As I keep tossing and turning, ayy

Maybe I fell in order to take the place of those countless stars
(Hey-ey-ey)
The target of thousands of bright arrows is me alone, ayy

You've shown me I have reasons
I should love myself (Oh-oh-oh)
I'll answer with my breath, my path

The me of yesterday
The me of today
The me of tomorrow
(I'm learning how to love myself)
With no exceptions, it's all me

Maybe there's no answer (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe this isn’t the answer either (Alright)
It’s just that loving myself
Doesn't require anyone else's permission
I'm looking for myself again
But I don't wanna die anymore
Me, who used to be sad
Me, who used to be hurt
It'll make me more beautiful
Yes, I have that beauty (Uh-huh)
Knowing that is going (Alright)
On the path to loving myself (No way)
It's what I need the most
Uh, I'm walking for myself (Ayy)
It's an action needed for me
My attitude towards myself
That's the happiness I need for me
I'll show you what I got
I'm not afraid because it's me (Love myself)

From the very beginning
To the very end
There's only one answer, ayy

Why do you keep trying to hide under your mask? (Hey-ey-ey)
Even all the scars from your mistakes make up your constellation, ayy

You've shown me I have reasons
I should love myself (Oh-oh-oh)
I'll answer with my breath, my path

Inside of me, there's still (Oh-oh)
That awkward part of me but
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)

You've shown me I have reasons
I should love myself (I'm learning how to love myself)
(Oh-oh-oh)
I’ll answer with my breath, my path (Oh-woah-oh)

The me of yesterday
The me of today
The me of tomorrow (Woah)
(I'm learning how to love myself)
With no exceptions, it's all me
