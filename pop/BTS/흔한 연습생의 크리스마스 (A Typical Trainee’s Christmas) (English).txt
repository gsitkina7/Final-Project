Last Christmas I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Our boss was indifferent, even three years ago
We've never had the dinner outing that everyone else has
Outside, it's like a party
Us guys are bunched together as if we're in the army
This yеar I'll be either practicing or sitting alonе in the corner
Nothing changes no matter how hard I try, I'm solo
But boss, we don't want a solo victory
All we want is a dinner outing
I can't stand it anymore because I'm so lonely
It's the middle of December and my lips are chapped
I haven't matched up to anybody these days, I should give up
No girlfriend either because our debut is soon
Hah, idols are getting married yet
Separating the male and female trainees? How does that make sense
We can't love so how do we write love song lyrics
If it were up to me, I'd be encouraging dating

(They tell me to come) The company keeps telling me to practice
(This year, again) I spent my whole day practicing
(I'm crying) I'm still a trainee
I really want to debut next year

Over here poop, poop, poop, hey over there poop, poop, poop
This isn't snow, it's poop, poop, poop!
Look at the sky, it’s raining white poop
God really has no manners at all, none at all
Even my forever alone friend Myungsoo is going to a solo victory party
I want to rest on that day and at least hold a snowman's hand
Our company, our boss, I don't like any of you
I miss my mom
My upcoming second Christmas, I don't even remember what I did last year
That's how boring and uneventful that day was
My name is Jeon Jungkook, my other name is maknae
Then I should be doing aegyo, as a ninth grader should
Boss, you're the one who is in charge of BigHit
Manager, even the other official is at home, sleeping
(Oh my god!) I'm going to cry if I can't play
If I can't, I'll kneel down in front of the company door

(They tell me to come) The company keeps telling me to practice
(This year, again) I spent my whole day practicing
(I'm crying) I'm still a trainee
I really want to debut next year

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Ayo, hitman Bang introduces: Hit It, the second audition
Dominate your opponent with rapping, dancing, or singing

I entered BigHit three years ago through Hit It
Making it through the obstacles, history in the making
We hold the Bangtan badge
But don't spit out rhymes and flow like our boss

I'm a bumpkin from Ilsan
Making it to the nation's top 1%
I got an unexpected call during my midterms
That was it, I became solo after picking up that call

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Merry Christmas everyone
