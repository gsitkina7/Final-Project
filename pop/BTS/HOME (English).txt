I'm exhausted man
Oh, guess what?
I just wanna go home

In this excitement that's driving me crazy
I wasn't even able to greet you (Yeah, right)
Yeah I'm going out baby
The whole world is my home

Crazy for myself (Yeah)
Like everything would work out when I opened that door (Right)
Like I was about to show something (Uh huh)
I left home
(Hoping all this imagination doesn't end as illusions)

Oh yeah I did it, me shine with flashin' lights
Got lotta friends, my quiet personal space
Yeah, I remember when I thought I could do everything
I saw the ocean, yeah, before I opened this door
Oh yeah

Whatever I fill becomes emptier
The more we're together, I feel lonelier
Half-closed eyes, sleepless light
The place where you are

That place is probably Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich (Yeah)
That place is no other than Mi Casa
Turn it on, your switch (Switch)
Yeah

It's comfortable even as you say nothing
With you, anywhere will be my home
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

Your love your love your love, I miss that
Your love your love your love, I want that
Your touch your touch your touch, I need that
La la la la la la la la I love it

My feet look strange in the entrance with lights off
I still feel strange as I close my eyes inside my blanket
I feel like I'm floating, both eyes spinning
In this fabulous space, I feel completely shabby

Totally shabby
The world thinks we own the whole world
Even if we have what I wanted in my dreams
Big house, big cars, big rings
The unfamiliar feeling of missing something
For someone who has accomplished everything
But I go out the door since I know I have something to return to

I keep remembering you between crossroads
You knew me when I had nothing else
I could smile at the thought of you
The place where you are

That place is probably Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich (Rich)
That place is no other than Mi Casa
Turn it on, your switch (Switch)
Yeah

It's comfortable even as you say nothing
If you are there, they'll all be my home
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

One day
Will you open the door for me
When the doorbell rings three times
So that I could give the parting words
That I did not finish
I'll tell you then

It's been a while, Mi Casa
With you I just feel rich
I'm back, Hi, Mi Casa
You left it on, your switch
Yeah

It's comfortable even as you say nothing
It became my home because you were there
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home
(Yeah)

Your love your love your love, I miss that
Your love your love your love, I want that
Your touch your touch your touch, I need that
La la la la la la la la I love it
