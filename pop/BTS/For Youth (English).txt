I want you forever
I want to be forever with you, ah
Forever we are young
Lily among the raindrops
This running maze that wanders
Forever we are young
Even if you fall and get hurt
Endlessly running towards the dream

If I never met you
Oh, what am I like, baby
Every time I miss you (Miss you)
Those words that have became a habit
(It's so true)

When I opened my eyes 10 years ago
I was watching around Nonhyeon-dong
I cried so easily
When you laugh
When I just looked back
After many seasons
You always here with us together
And every second was forever, oh

Mind's unmeasurable
My life was slipping
When your head hits the pillow
I didn't want to wake up tonight (Wake up)
Now you are here
This a new home to me
I'll be back anytime
Baby, don't you worry
This road we walk
Everything will be a way, oh

If I never met you
Oh, what am I like, baby
Every time I miss you (Miss you)
Those words that have became a habit
(It's so true)
You're my best friend
For the rest of my life

Oh, one, two, three
Our sun, ayy
Can't forget, mmh
Every moment, ayy
Oh, my spring day
I was like myself, thanks to the flower that took responsibility
Your countless words that comforted me, oh, oh, oh
That's what made myself, oh, oh, oh
Yes, you're my youth
Again, my youth, my grateful friend
My pride, heaven, and love
It was dark everywhere (It was dark)
In the meantime, a ray of light (A ray of light)
I'm really glad it's you
We shine because we are together

Running
Falling again
Get myself up
Falling down, oh
Would you give me your hand
How many times will it happen
If you are tired, you can rest awhile (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm always here, waiting for you
Daydreamin' 'bout us facin'
Really don't wanna say it, but

If I never met you
Oh, what am I like, baby
Every time I miss you (Miss you)
Those words that have became a habit
(It's so true)
You're my best friend
For the rest of my life
I wish I could turn back time

When everything was easy at that time (At that time)
I should've told you more (Told you)
I'll be with you
For the rest of my life, ooh, ooh, yeah
Rest of my life
