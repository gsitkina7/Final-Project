V: Go Suga, go...
Suga: Suga! Okay, I'll start, Suga, yo, uh
Others: Go Suga! Go Suga! Go Suga!
Suga: Suga, uh, yo, uh
My name is S-U-G-A
Other rappers are all behind me
Same as always, I tease my tongue
This way and that over this beat
All your rap makes me sleepy
Shall we rewind the CD?
Our music makes women cry
Our name is Bangtan
What's coming out of your mouth right now... Impressive?

Others: Impressive?
J-Hope: Hey, don't fool with us!
Suga: Who's next? Next, Next
Rap Monster: Oh, the music's good
J-Hope: Rap Monster?
Suga: Who? Rapmon?
Rap Monster: Now, let's get this
Others: Yo Rapmon! Yo Rapmon!

I'm a cool boy
I'm a nice boy
But my voice is a devil
You have one shot, I have four shots
I'm the Igatan that heals you
Your rap is fat, mine is thin
You are ribbon pig
I win the game with my feet
Comme Des, Rolex, Dior, Hermes
All of these are words that suit me
But the words that suit are are tacky or trashy
Or just Pompeii
You just erupted, just know your enemy
Wait, guys, I need to pee
Others: Oh, ho
J-Hope: Nwappwappwappwa wow
Rap Monster: Seriously, I need to go
BTS: Go Jungkook! Go Jungkook!
Rap Monster: Jeon Jungkook!
BTS: Go Jungkook!
Rap Monster: Jeon Jungkook!

Today again, got ya
My freestyle rapping
I follow the beat and show off by setting
Like the Top MC, with MCM
And Gucci, Alexander McQueen
Well, that's that, I'm different now
When I first rapped I walked with the beat
In 10 days, I beat the rhythm and caught them all
Jungkook, look at me, look at me, look at me

BTS: Wow!
Suga: Who's next? Who's next? Next
V: Ah, should I do it?
BTS: Go Taehyung! Go Taehyung! Go Taehyung!

Knock, knock, I'll go, cypher
Alright, so I heard your raps very well
Namjoon's lyrics have become mature now
Your rap skills are back to back
It's a compliment, just stop it, stop it
Hope's in front of me, he's getting nervous now
Why are you shaking? Go make some kimchi
My Daegu dialect, it's alive!
Yoongi, you're alive, son
BTS: Yeah!
Rap Monster: He's alive!
J-Hope: Ah, now, J-Hope, come forth, J-Hope, hey?
BTS: Hope is on his way! Hope is on his way!

This is a skit, a part of our music
I'll show you here, my knife skill
My, my, my, my, my name is J-Hope
I'm so cool that I leave a trace
Like that pose
God damn, I'm the hip-hop son of Gwangju
This is the start of Jeolla-do rap
I'll shake you up until you go bust
Because we're really smashing

BTS: Oh? Oh, oh...
Rap Monster: Uh, uh, is it now Jin?
BTS: Go march! Go march! Go march!
Suga: Oh, Jin is also gonna do it?
Rap Monster: Yah, he's gotten better
Jin: Yeah

My name is Jin (Jin!)
I'm the most handsome
My nickname, Jindda (Jindda)
But recently the "Dda" fell out, yeah
(Rap Monster: Yeah, and then what?)
Yeah, so my nickname is Jin (Jin!)
So my stage name is Jin (Jin!)

Rap Monster: Hey, who, who, who's left?
BTS: Yo, uh, Jimin?
Jimin: Shall I show you? Shall I show the strength of the vocal team?
BTS: Go Jimin! Go Jimin! Go Jimin!

Yo, yo, my name is Jimin
My rap makes the vocal team wet their pants
Taehyung, your rap smells fishy
Try to know at who I am beforehand

All: Ah... What was that? Just leave, leave, leave, leave
Rap Monster: Ah... what was that, go then
BTS: Leave, leave, leave, leave...
Jimin: I'm sorry
V: I knew you were gonna diss me
Jimin: Uh, I... won't do it again
Suga: I don't think you should rap... Go away...
BTS: Migrate, migrate, migrate, migrate! Go migrate
Jimin: Sorry!
V: Sorry, haha
BTS: Leave!
Suga: Hey, the cypher's over, shall we go out to eat?
V: In Incheon?
Rap Monster: I don't wanna eat
Jimin: What, ah, I'm so hungry I could die
Jungkook: Hey, Suga says he's going to buy for lobster soondae for us! Let's go
Suga: Let's go! I'll treat you all!
Rap Monster: I'm not gonna eat anything except if it's Nanakon
Jimin: Hey, leave him
Jungkook: I just want Nanakon from earlier
J-Hope: See you tomorrow, Namjoon
Suga: Hey, I'm leaving, Namjoon
Rap Monster: Seriously, this is unfair
Jimin: Rap Monster, we're leaving
Rap Monster: Go! Go, go! Go!
Jin: You've done well
