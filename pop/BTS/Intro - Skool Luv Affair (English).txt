First encounter, first text, first phone call
First date, first kiss In our own space
I want everything to be a first with you
I have an eating disorder, whatever I eat, I’m still hungry
For you. The word “addiction” can’t express all of this
Describing a girl like you is impossible
It transcends the poetic
It’s because of you, like a capital letter
I want to place you first in my life
A good house, a good car, those things can’t be
Happiness but I want to give it to you

Hold on, hold on, turn off the music for a second
Why?
Hyung, this isn’t it
What?
What’s up with that last line ‘doo go bwa’
It’s actually ‘joo go pa’
Oh really? Well let me show you my style
Give me the music!
Yeah, that’s right, this is it!
Hyung, this kinda style!
Love should be hopeful!

Confessing my love without hesitating is my style
If it’s for you, I’m the type to sacrifice my body
I’ll always shine the light on you girl
This is a love stage for you and me
We’re blinded by love, sweet and playful
Our future is bright and dazzling, colorful
If I have you, it’s like I have everything, like a milli
The door of love has opened now with you, go in

Ahh, this is awesome
Love should be hopeful!
How can life always be hopeful?
This is not the Bangtan style
Then what is it?”
Bangtan style is hip-hop
Hip-hop?
Let’s go

BTS, the way we love
Whether you’re in your
Teens or twenties, love is all the same
RM, so now I’m telling you the story
I loved this much before, how about you?
This is just an intro shouting bout
My whole mind and body
You know that her refusals
And bad words could never stop me
They could never retard me
This is my ideology
Who in the world can dampen
My heart’s blood? Nobody
(Wassup) I’ll ask you again
(Wassup) How about yo?
If you haven’t loved yet
How about doing it like me?
A person’s emotions is so strange
I’m the one who makes you smile but
You go to the bastard who makes you cry
(I said) Yeah that’s love
(I said) yeah that’s love
Some may call me a loser but I’m really OK
As if I’ve never been hurt by love before
As if I’ll give even more
When she takes away my all
Wassup

When in love, be passionate
When you’re singing, make it prickly
Passionate and prickly

When we’re in love, we’re passionate
When we’re singing, we’re prickly
Passionate and prickly

This is Bangtan style
This is Bangtan style
This is Bangtan style
Bangtan style, Bangtan style
Wassup
