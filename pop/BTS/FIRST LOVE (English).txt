The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side

I remember that moment
Way taller than my height
The brown piano that guided me
I looked up to you, I yearned for you
When I touched you with my small finger

I feel so nice mom I feel so nice
I played the piano wherever my hands took me
I didn't know your significance back then
Back then I was content with just looking at you

I remember back during my elementary school days
When my height
Became taller than yours
I neglected you when I once yearned for you so
On top of the white jade-like keyboard
Dust is piling on
Your image that has been neglected
Even then I didn't know
Your significance
No matter where I am
You always defended that spot
But I didn't know that would be the last
You say don't leave like this

Don't worry even if I leave
You'll do well on your own
I remember when I first met you
Before I knew it you grew up
Though we are putting an end to our relationship
Don't ever feel sorry to me
I will get to meet you again no matter what form
Greet me happily then

I remember back then when I met you that
I had completely forgotten, when I was around 14
The awkwardness was only for a moment, I touched you again
Even though I was gone for a long time
Without repulsion
You accepted me
Without you I am nothing
After the dawn, two of us
We welcomed the morning together
Don't let go of my hand forever
I won't let go of you again either

I remember back then
We burned up the last of my teen's
Yes the days when we couldn't see an inch in front of us
We laughed, we cried
Those days with you, those moments are now in memories
I said, grasping my crushed shoulder
I really can't do any more
Every time I wanted to give up
By my side you said
Bastard you can really do it
Yeah, yeah I remember back then
When I was fed up and lost
Back then when I fell into a pit of despair
Even when I pushed you away
Even when I resented meeting you
You were firmly by my side
You didn't have to say anything
So don't ever let go of my hand
I won't let you go ever again either
My birth and the end of my life
You will be there to watch over it all

The corner of my memory
A brown piano settled on one side
In the corner of my childhood house
A brown piano settled on one side
