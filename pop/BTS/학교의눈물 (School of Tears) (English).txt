"Nice kid complex" that was my illness
(But I was still nice to everyone)
That was my excuse
Behind my back they were talking shit
In front of me they were acting nice
I pretended not to notice, school was a battleground
Perhaps this was my own battle in the ring called classroom
Someone would've brushed it off as something you shouldn't carе about
Oh I don't care, but that's something only adults can do easily
Not pеrpetrators
Not victims
This is a place where we've turned into bystanders!
Even if you point your finger at me and call me coward
I'm fine with it, but how would you define it?
You know I can't lend you a hand
If I did that I'll end up the same as you
Don't be blinded by justice, the hero is dead
This is a reality, the only way to survive, there are no options
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom

(SUGA) The basis of a school violence
A vicious that can never end
There's no exit in this crowded ring called a classroom
That's right, in the end
School is like another mini society
A jungle made carelessly by adults
They made the weaklings weak, they made the strong powerful
Of course since they were strong
They made the weak suffer
A society built on the teachings that friends are only to pretend
The morals of adults made us step on the weaks to rise the top
Corporal punishment has been banned
In a moment of force
"I didn't know because I was out of it" became an excuse
That's right, this society is filled with bystanders
That are no different from perpetrators
The students trapped inside classrooms
Known as themselves are also victims
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
