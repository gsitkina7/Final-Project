Damn the hip-hop pride, idol rapper? Cut that bullshit
He’s essentially an idol shit anyway – they look down on me
They give their principles to the dogs and laugh at my name
You only know how to go with the tide
And look down on others, how you kill me?
So I bring the monster back
My monster swag
So this is the monster track
Cuz of my freakin' monster rap
The modern day Hong Kil Dong’s
They see good things but can’t call it good
Third-generation leader, so I’mma lead ya
This is a generation change – I’m sayin'
Yeah I’m the top of the top of the top
Poppin em, rockin' em, stoppin' em, blockin' 'em
Like the Cassius’ lance – Imma don
Don’t turn the beat off becuz I’m not freakin' done
Don’t play around on top of the beat
Cuz every kick is my freaking zone
I was always generous
But now I’mma murder you rappers
Cut em up by order
Then I’mma murder you haters
Now look at me and tell me, who’s in your top 5?
Rap Monster, Randa, Leader, Rapmon, your dad

Right now it’s hope world from BTS
Everyone follows me, my potential gets retweeted
Let everyone know my flow
Ride your eardrums and fill your bodies
I sharpened my sword for tomorrow
Get back in the days
Considering my age, I was a kid who didn’t know rhymes
I was just a common kid
From Gwangju who looked at idols
Now I’ll show you, on the Cypher on top of this track
I’ll reveal my aspirations, I’m above the minors
It’s a major different from you, uh
I fill up the TV screen
Rapper costume? No, I take away the foam and spit it out
Whatever I want – Wherever I go, it becomes an issue
If you’re jealous, go to the hospital, two weeks to heal
Everyone who hoped for my defeat is holding onto their necks
J-Hope plays a foul on top of the game that rides with
Hip-hop pride

I have yet to go to the army but my hobby is sharpshooting
We are bulletproof was a big hit
The clumsy fakers was pricked and reacted
Feel a little more inferior, the quality of my pronunciation is 4k
I’m dope man, I’m the Chopin of the beat
I won’t ever change, I was born a rapper
My attitude is my mentor
Even if you talk smack about me, I’m memento
Show your hip-hop pride but you’ll still feel impotent
Hide your jealousy, I can see your IP address
I’m a boiler, I get hot in an instant
Like a spoiler, you’re so typical
Fixed up and stupid hip-hop losers with nothing inside
It’s too hard to last in this growing world of K-Pop
So just rap as a hobby
It’s the end of the world, if you’re guilty, try harder, what
