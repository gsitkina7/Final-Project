I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
We met in a crowded place
Expression on her face
The look in her eyes says she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I made my move
Then hand it for, she’s seconds away
Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Time was standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body movement all night long
Then she took my hand, instantly we danced
She knew by my angst that I wanted more
Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Oh babe
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and you
(in love, in love, in love)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?
(in love, in love, in love)
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and you
(in love, in love, in love)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?
(in love, in love, in love)
Me & you, me & you, me & you
I think about you girl
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Got me thinking ’bout you
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
