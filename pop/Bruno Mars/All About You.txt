I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I am usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know
I must admit I have felt this way for more than quite a while
But I cannot hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Cannot wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more
Oooh

Girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you

Maybe I am a fool for speaking up but I do not mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do
And the look that you are giving me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I will change my ways I will
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothing to lose
I have got nothing to lose

Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you
Girl when you smile
Not a place I would rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you will see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That is why I have to take this time baby to tell you
Oh, and now you know
And now you know

Girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I am all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I am all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I am all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
