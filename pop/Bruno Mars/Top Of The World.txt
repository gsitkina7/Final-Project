It's your boy Bruno
I’m going to take you to the top girl, hey
Top of the world. You ready?
Come on (let's go)

I feel higher than the ceiling
Cause I'm floating on this feeling
So long my feet have been up off the floor
Destiny is what I call it
My Heart's for sale and girl you bought it
The moment that you walk right through the door ooh
Till the day that I stop living
Girl my love I won't stop giving
Cross my heart and hope to die my love is yours
And I pray girl that this feeling
Is something that we always feeling
If you're with it girl, hear me girl
This is what I'll do

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I aren’t never felt this way before

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours
Ha ooh it feels so good baby yeah

And to me you're like a flower
It's a blessing every hour
And I get to spend this time with you
And I won't take you for granted next to you is where I'm standing
Girl you're a dream come true

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I aren’t never felt this way before (cause I aren’t never felt this way before)

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand (where we'll stand girl)
You just say the word and girl it's yours (the word and girl its yours)

Just take my hand ooh
We can float to the sky, baby just you and I
Never let you go
Just take my hand
So many things I want to show you girl
While we're on top of the world


On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours (you just say the word and girl its yours)

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours

It's all for you girl
