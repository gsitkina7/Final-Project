We had a date, I stood you up
You tried to call, but I didn't pick up
See I forgot about our plans, please forgive me for ruining your night so many times

I'm sorry, I know you're mad
And I don't want to be like every other man that you had
So I'm stopping all the childish things
Girl, you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose
Girl, I know I broke your heart
Trusting me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today

I'm tired of playing
The kiss and make-up game
And I apologize for the man I became
If I could do it all again
I would have helped my best friend
And I would throw away all my selfish ways


I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today
