Oooohhhhhhh
Oooooohhhhhh

I used to go out of my mind
Tryna' redefine the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity, forgot about me
I was so lost in us
I had to take hold, cause you had me
Stuck in the middle of nowhere
And my faith, it would shake
I know you're trying your best
To take me

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
(Instrumental break)

You used to be
The man of my dreams
Only now it seems
You were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine
Told me "Open my eyes
There's more than darkness out there"
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
And my faith is in place
In the night, I no longer see your face

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long

Oooooooohhh
From ashes to ashes
And dust to us
Oooooohhhhhh
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long

Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
