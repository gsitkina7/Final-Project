I I I don't know why why
It seems like every other night
You pick a fight fight
I kind of know I do the the same
Be calling you out your name
This is not what lovers are supposed to do do
You tell me to go go
I start walking out out
When we both know know
What we're all about bout
We fuss fight and scream
And it’s all because of our love
But you and I both know we never giving up
Every time I try to leave something tells me to turn around round round round
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down down down
Cause I know we can work it out, work it out, talk it out, talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Every time I try to leave we find a way to figure it out
That’s why I always turn around

Now wait wait before you say say
Something you know you'll take back later on today day
Sometimes you drive me crazy but I love you bay
All I ask is that you always appreciate me
You tell me to go go
I start walking out out
When we both know know
What we're all about about
We fuss fight and scream
And it’s all because I love you
But you and I both know we never giving up


Aren’t nobody that can love me like you love me
That’s why I always turn around for you you you you you you you you
Aren’t nobody that can love me like you love me
That’s why i always turn around for you you you you you you you
Its only for you
Every time I try to leave something tells me to turn around
(Something tells me Something’s tells me)
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down (the only one that hold me down)
Cause I know we can work it out, (oh) work it out, talk it out, (ooh) talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Every time I try to leave we find a way to figure it out
That’s why I always turn around
