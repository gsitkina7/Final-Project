E-eh-eh-eh
You said that I was so not afraid
You said that I was just a 
But I'm not trying my best to owe it
You told me that I'm not to follow
And you only knew what you do, babe
If you only saw what I was
But I'm not trying to bet this only
Because you can't count my own deals on it
Oh I want to touch you with the lights on
Oh I want to freak you with the light-
My lonely girl you're my only girl
This is so not your fault
You're my only girl (Yeah)
