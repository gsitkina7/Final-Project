The best things in live are free
You can give it to the bears and bees
I want some money
That's what I want
I want some money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want!
You love gives me the thrills
But your love pays me no bills
I want some money
That's what I want
I want some money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want!
