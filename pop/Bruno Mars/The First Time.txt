I feel like dancing the night away
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh

Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh
I think i might explode, this tension is so cold
And all this fighting between us is really getting old
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up
We've both had enough, we've both had enough
So let's just get away, go to that special place
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away
Baby it's worth a try, I believe in you and I
Only takes just one night

Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again



Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
Ooh
