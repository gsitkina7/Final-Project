Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now

Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York

Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new life
In New York

And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's
A waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
In New York

It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything that you want
A new love
In New York
