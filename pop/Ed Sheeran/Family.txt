Hmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps

I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a MÃ©gane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again
See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go

To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly)
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking "I just wanna see my brother"
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up

To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
