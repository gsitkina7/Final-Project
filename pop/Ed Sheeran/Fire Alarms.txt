The rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are wavingÂ 

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
