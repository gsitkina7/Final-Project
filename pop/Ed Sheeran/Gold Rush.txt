Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved
I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?

You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that

And maybe you should learn to love her
