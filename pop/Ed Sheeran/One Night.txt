Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention, as she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency to finish off her sentence?
Oh, well, she's a local girl
No make-up 'cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
Is it fast food? I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

And we've got that love in us, so if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night 'til th floor feel us
If we talk outside, so you hate wasps, too?
I don't really dance, so I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright, I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don't mind sharing
She said, "I wanna take off what you're wearing"
And I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

She's like the fast food, I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she's all I need

Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
Now tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
