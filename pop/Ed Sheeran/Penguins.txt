I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere

Well, darlin', here we go again
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?

She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls

Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?

And it feels like we found serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
