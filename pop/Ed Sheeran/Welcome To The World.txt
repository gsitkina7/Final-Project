Welcome to the world
I heard your heart beat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound
Of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here

And ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like I loved you
And yes, you were the first
Brought a new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know

Ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away

Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Oh, welcome to the world (Welcome to the world)
Welcome to the world (Welcome to the world)

Ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
You got the kick? (It just kicked)
Did it actually? (Yeah)
(Are you wakin' up?)
