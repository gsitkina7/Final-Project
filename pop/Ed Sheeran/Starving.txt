Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till

You know just what to say, some things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can’t move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Oh, oh
Hey
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don’t need butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you

By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted

You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak at my knees
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Yeah, yeah
I was so much younger yesterday

Hey
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don’t need butterflies when you bring me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
I was so much younger yesterday

Hey
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don’t need butterflies when you bring me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you

By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
