I will remember you
In the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
Sunset looked today
As if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down

Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say
She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away

I will remember you
With white wine by the barbecue
On New York at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind
When I think about the time
Is a memory of laughin' out loud

Oh, I wish, that I could take the pain away
And just talk to him in person
But it's time for me to call your son again
And say

She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
This doesn't make sense
I wish I could change it, but
I can't do anything
My heart is racin'
And my soul is achin', lover

She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away

Hey, the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
