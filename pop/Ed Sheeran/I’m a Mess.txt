Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover?
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)

For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover?
