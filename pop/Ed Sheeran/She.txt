I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I’d never leave her
But now I’m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She’s endless to me
She’s just like paperwork
But harder to read

Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won’t you stay?" She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I’ll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
