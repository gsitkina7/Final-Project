Paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop)
Took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot

Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
