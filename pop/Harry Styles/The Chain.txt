Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
If you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Hear you saying, never break the chain)
If you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Hear you saying, never break the chain)

Hey
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chains keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together
