Yeah

You can have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You can have an airplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need
You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, and around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
The amusement never ends

I want to be your sledgehammer
Call my name
Let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony
Sledge sledge

Show me round your fruit cakes
'Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruit cakes
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

I'm gonna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Call sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
There be no doubt about it
Sledge
Sledge
Sledge

I kicked the habit (kicked the habit, kicked the habit)
Shed my skin (Shed my skin)
This is the new stuff (This is the new stuff)
I go dancing in (We go dancing in)
Won't you show for me (Show for me)
I will show for you (Show for you)
Will you show for me (Show for me)
I will show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, coming through
Gotta feel that power
Gonna feel that rhythm
Gotta feel that rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you
(Show for me, show for me)
Come on, come on, help me through
