One, two, three

Beam me up (Beam me up)
Count me in (Count me in)
Three, two, one (Three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (Here we go)
Here we go (Here we go)
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)
I was in your wet dream, drivin' in the car
Saw you at the side of the road, there's no one elsе around
You're touching yourself, touching yourself, touching your—
Touching yoursеlf, touching yourself

You said, "Baby, do you want to come home with me?
I've got Buffalo '66 on DVD"
You said, "Baby, do you want to come home with me?
I've got Buffalo '66 on DVD"

Beam me up (Beam me up)
Count me in (Count me in)
Three, two, one (Three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (Here we go)
Here we go (Here we go)
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)

I was in your wet dream, driving in the car
What makes you think you're good enough to think about me
When you're touching yourself, touching yourself, touching your—
Touching yourself, touching yourself?
You climb onto the bonnet and you're licking the windscreen
I've never seen anything so obscene
It's enough to make a girl blush
It's enough, it's enough to make a girl blush
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
Oh, it's enough, oh, it's enough, oh, it's enough
(One, two, three, oh!)
One, two, three, four!

(Beam me up, beam me up)
(Count me in, count me in)
(Three, two, one, three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (Here we go)
Here we go (Here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Beam me up (Beam me up)
Count me in (Count me in)
Three, two, one (Three, two, one)
Let's begin
