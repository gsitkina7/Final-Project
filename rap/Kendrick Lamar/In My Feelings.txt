Ain’t Saying I’m perfect
I love my Bruddas I
Slag iron for em
Free All My Niggas
Locked Up doing time
For it
Impact for that chopper hit
His head make a loud Noise
Really cam from the bottom
Want something gotta
Grind for it
(Yeah) Where I came from
Niggas Wildin & Inve gotta keep
Ya gun
Told My Son Daddy A Savage
I Kant go for none
Mama know I’m Thuggin
Ride around wit em drums
Know how I’m coming real street
Niggas Idgaf
Told Jasmin Our love is forever
Ain’t no switching up
My heart was down Bad
She picked me up
Tell me calm down I got
A son
I gotta which it Up
Spend a bin & hope
Out I’m tryna burn em up
Since talking like he steppin
But he ain’t cut like us
My Bruddas really On dummy
They know to keep it tucked
They ride around tweaking tryn
Let it bust
Where I came from
Gotta keep a gun
No I ain’t prefect
Was it worth it

A lot shit changed
Got a son to look after ain’t
No letting up
Wanna Apologize mama for all da
Times I was fucking up
In and out of different Acacian
But ya neva gave up
I was ten toes down behind
My Bruddas I Neva gaf

Hope out wit dat 30
Watch it rip em up
Kle told me switch ya style
