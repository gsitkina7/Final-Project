So they looking for me
They don't know
I'm waiting on them
Right here, I'ma sit by the window
See they gonna have to get me
Yeah, they gonna have to get me
Come get me

Damn shame, why they let me get a champagne, uh
The young can produce thunder, I make black rain, uh
Blood stain saw all over his black range, uh
Catch him at the lights to turn off his lights mane
Life been treating me right so I can't complain, uh
Career 'bout to take flight, G4 plane (Yep)
I stunt niggas growth in this rap shit
Suggest you react quick or invest in some globe games
I'm propane and hard liquor, bow down to who
What nigga, toss bullets like flea flickers
To the fullest, I'ma get it to the core
And they tape pictures, yellow tape, stretched out, inches
I can't wait like the first day of school
Waking up, three in the morning, looking at my shoes
But this time around, I be looking are my tool
Wiping it down,  every other commercial now
Hold my mom, it's nothing to hurt you
Two straps on my side, I'm looking like , blaw
Did I do that, yes I did
I told you the truth, cause no witnesses, I'm the truth
Still, I remain calm like a soldier in war
Surrounded by, three bombs, cautious
Shots keep coming like I got three arms
Two trigger fingers over one bomb, let it breathe
Hm, I'm surprise
Ya'll not here yet
Plans must have change
But I'm still here
I even let the backdoor open
Come on now

Kill 'em, kill 'em, send 'em to the morgue
Let 'em fill him with a brimming fluid
We ain't sorry for nothing
We ain't tryna play hardcore nothing
But you overdid it when you push the button
So we caught the USSR, push the button on it
Let it blew up a few cars
You really don't want it  and your homie don't want it neither
Shoe string, choke 'em up, let 'em get no breather
No pressure, black and white, the skies
Looking like uncle Fester, poppin' up on you guys
The .22 fit right between my bitch thighs
If you blink once, it be pointing right between your eyes
You better off tryna plan your own suicide
Cause it's nothing, but torture if you want you to die
The 745 got weed in it, riding with the .45, times two the speed limit
I pop eyes for a  that spinach
Cut 'em down to the white meat, have 'em no skinnin'
I'm not finish until my niggas ate too
So any given time they can grace you
What you want? Casket, await due
My pain in a box is quite more you
So they can see the damage done at the wake view
Hide 'em hollow tips, hopscotch on the face you breathe
So ya'll still ain't here
So I guess there's a first time for everything if ya'll don't come
But I'm still here
In fact I'm still waiting for someone else
Punch

Yeah, I got the range of a 
From nine hundred yards by the grass I been walkin'
See, so don't think I don't see you dudes creepin'
Reaching for my spot, then spot a niggas breathin'
A grown man, ya'll cats barely 
Lil dudes tryna catch me like they wide receiving
Stop it, , custom drop it
That's one point two, minus the roof, don't stop rams
I'm in the cockpit, windows up, black tint
I'm not from 'round here, it's like I breathe with an accent
Whether you has been, future or present
I remove you from your flesh, teach you dudes a lesson
'Cuse the digression, abuse studio sessions
I'ma fool on the , the dude, no question
Uncomfortable homie, barefoot in the booth
Stop and breathe for a second, inhale the truth
Breathe niggas
I'm restless know
Ya'll took to long
Maybe next time
Or maybe even I come to you
Hm, but for know
I'ma just get my
