Uh, oh, y'all know what it is
Uh, it's that Compton—ish (Woo!)

Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights (Yeah)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice (Right)
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights (Ad lib)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice (Let's go)
I'm back at it again
My city back at it with 'em
Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems, uh
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind till it's strong enough to fuck with mine
Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
I'm black with thoughts of Einstein
One word describing him: genius
What you know about the city I live in?
With the souls of the dead is livin'?
You don't know about our living conditions
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
But it's more than just weed and women
Gangsters, husslers, bullet collisions
Players, pimps, who can envision?
The place where I reside where Eazy was pitchin'
Dre was 6'4 lifting, NWA had mention
Quik had the turn tables mixin'
The first ones to say fuck the system
I'm tryin' to tell you about

Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, yeah, homie, that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life (Yeah)
His own street like concrete
Would best describe fit his gutter but see, I'm what's underneath
A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef
I'm from the land of organized crime, disorderly peace
‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares can't forget the police
'Cause in the hood tellin' pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
But when you see 'em please be quick on your feet
That they go, watch em!
Had you for road, kill just like a possum
You could contain 'em, but there's no way that you can stop 'em
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
The same time, hope the system don't lock 'em
'Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches, we barely got 'em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
We back, that's for my people, it's official

Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Let's bring it back
Back to the streets, of course
Yeah, uh, Compton, right, uh
Homie, homie

I don't know if he new around here
But it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
'Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit, whatever you don't care
It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But I'm amazed 'cause the young boy been here for years
I've seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
A nightmare on my street, it's Fred Krueger where I live
Minus the actress and the producers
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia
We back, that's for my people, it's official

Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life

Uh, right, we back
Uh, I see, I see
I see it's me , CID, what?
 why Compton's me, nigga
Haha
It's for my people loneliness
