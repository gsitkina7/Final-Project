I’m staying late yeah
She left her man and now she with me changing pace yeah
Stare at her face and I get butterflies it ain’t fair
She give a blank stare
She just ain’t used to get spoiled by a man who cares
Verse 1:
Threw my mismatch socks on then I’m walking in yo crib
Yeah my last girl buggin so I told her this is it
You my next boo , you gon do me right , Ima do it too
Winter gon be coo , me and you , and your  family too
All this sleep I’m losing
Out of school , now they shooting
Killed my homie , seen his mother cry now I’m traumatized cause she screaming  why
Brеakdown: (This whole part is just me talking about my last girl evеr lol)
Verse 2:
Ooh and she be killing with the long hair , told her watch her ankle now she blushing cause she love it here
Told her let me compliment her body she a hottie do a spin girl
Don’t need no makeup for your skin girl
That’s my queen and my hermosa touch her and I’ll air these bullets out the fucking

Chorus 2:
Cause I know what you chasing you can only get this feeling from a thug you can only get this feeling from a thug
Outro:
Beauty and the beast pretty girl with a gangster I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay 100 never change up
