If I call your name, would you answer me?
And if I said goodbye, would you stay with me?
And if I promise you a place to go, when you are all alone
Would you take it and be on your way home?
God put us on this Earth to love
And He can take us back in the name of blood
And I know that might sound a little unfair
'Cause at the worst times, He takes the one you care for
And as cancer eats and eats, I'm waiting for my long sleep to finally
Take me home
And you'll finally be right where you belong
Where you were made, whеre you were mеant to be
When your feet touch the gold, the gold of the floor
And you'll see your past loved ones, and you'll need nothing more
Because you know that you're loved, wherever you are
We'll miss you so, but you're not that far
'Cause you're in our hearts
