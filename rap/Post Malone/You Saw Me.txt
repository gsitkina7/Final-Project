And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
I don't care, I wanna go right there
Tonight I swear, your mine, your mine and I'm

And I'm faded
So drunk I might need a facelift
And I got bottles in my bag that I'm facing
Girl I've gotta hit you up, I'm not waiting
And I really try to feel fine but I don't though
I got a place in my mind where I don't go
I really try to feel fine but I don't though
I've gotta battle emotions, I know it doesn't show
And when time hits 3AM
I'm like shit, I'm sad again
Shit I'm sad again
Shit I'm sad again

And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do more than we do
And I try to guide my eye to you
Tonight you and I could do morе than we do
I don't care, I wanna go right therе
Tonight I swear, your mine, your mine and I'm

And I know you saw me (told you)

Take another shot, said fuck it
Took another shot, now I'm on it, yeah
She said I'm sad until I get fucked up, yeah
That's why we all fucked up here
Took another shot, now I'm on it
