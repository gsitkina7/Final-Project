Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sometimes, some crimes (Some crimes)
Go slipping through the cracks
But these two gumshoes
Are picking up the slack
There's no case too big, no case too small
When you need help just call
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale's Rescue Rangers
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale, when there's danger
No, no, it never fails, once they're involved
Somehow, whatever's wrong gets solved
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale

Fresh prints, not since
Watson and Mr. Holmes
Havе two minds (Two minds), so fine (So fine)
Looked undеr every stone
When you need some help to save the day
They're never far away

Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale's Rescue Rangers
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale, when there's danger
No, no, it never fails, once they're involved
Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N—

Grey skies, it's trouble
Bad guys see double
When they're around
The Chips are never down
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale's Rescue Rangers
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale, when there's danger
No, no, it never fails, once they're involved
Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale (Oh, oh, oh, Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale)
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale (Ch-Ch-Chip 'N Dale)

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, oh
