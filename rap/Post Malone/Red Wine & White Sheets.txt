Hmm
Zaytoven
Ohh, woah, ohh

We standin' in the lobby waitin' for the elevator
We standin' in the lobby and we can't wait to get out
Let's just go crazy, let's say, "Fuck every'"
Let's make a baby, we gon' need new laundry
Oh, woah, I'm on the road
Can't wait to come home to you
Oh, I'm doin' all my shows
Can't wait to come back home to you

Red wine and white sheets, pour up that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely
Red wine and white sheets, pour up that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely

We standin' in the lobby waitin' for the elevator
We standin' in the lobby and we can't wait to get out
Let's just go crazy, let's say, "Fuck every'"
Let's make a baby, we gon' need new laundry

I know I lied to you, that only would do you
I told you I'm sorry, you know that was not me
And that lie wouldn't hang up, was rushin' through my fingertips
I ain't never gonna go back to the man I was then

Red wine and white sheets, pour up that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely
Red wine and white sheets, pour up that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely

Ah, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ah, ahh, ah, ahh, ah, ahh
Ah, ahh, ah, ahh, ah, ahh
You wonder if we got that , 
You know that if we stay , I'd be scared to run away
You wonder if we got that , 
You know that if we stay , I'd be scared to run away
You wonder if we got that , 
You know that if we stay , I'd be scared to run away
You wonder if we got that , 
You know that if we stay , I'd be scared to run away
