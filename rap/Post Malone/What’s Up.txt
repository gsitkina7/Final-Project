Blowin' on that horn

And the style, that's swag, bitch, you know I be on it (Ooh, ooh)

She said she like to kiss 'cause I got big lips
And we got all that chemistry
She show me images

You ain't gotta be real, baby, we could just pretend, aw
I got her coughin' and wheezin' every time I pass her the indo
Aw, goddamn, bruh, all this sauce
Keypad, unlock, then she pop her top (Brrp)
