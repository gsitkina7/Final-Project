Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I got this knot inside my throat, call my vodka up if I come
And I'm not suicidal, I just drink to forget my problems
Seems like the kids these days are all just lookin' to get higher, oh
I'm just the same, anything's I won't tell momma and father

Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today
You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothin' wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

I got my woman, got my high, my guitar, and some money
And I'll be goddamned if these fuckers try to take that from me
But ain't shit wrong with us and don't tell me, "Talk to somebody"
I'm drunk at 2 p.m., treat every day like it's a Friday

Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Not much to do these days, we sit and smoke my life away
Just like everyone else I know (Uh)
Not much to do these days, I got too much on the way
Sit back and light up and let go

You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh (Hey-oh-oh-oh), ooh-ooh
We're just stoned, leave us alone (Stoned)
Ooh-ooh (Hey-oh-oh-oh), ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned (Stoned)
