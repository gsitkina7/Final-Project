A-this thing (This thing)
I called love (I called love)
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
A-this thing
I called love
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll (Rock 'n' roll)
She drives me crazy (Crazy)
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool (Be cool)
Relax (Relax)
Get hip (Get hip)
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby (Baby)
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy (Crazy)
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool (Be cool)
Relax (Relax)
Get hip (Get hip)
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat (Back seat)
Hitch-hike (Hitch-hike)
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love, crazy little thing called love
