Uh-du-du, uh-du-du‚ uh-du-du‚ uh-du-du
Hey‚ remember the time you drove all night?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Night, night‚ night, night, yeah‚ yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy

They say love is blind, I can't do the time
I want a watch, this kind, but they don't know buyin'
With a bottle of Synthroid, can I buy it? I don't know
Ayy, hey, ayy
When I came up the top, when I came up from the bottom
And you was right there, I tell you, I saw you
And all of my diamonds shinin' even when I was
Was stuck in the dirt, you said it was
Ayy, they said it wouldn't hurt when you go
But I don't even know anymore
I'm so gone on a forty, yeah, you know
Yeah, ayy, hey
It's a moonshine, it's a moon-vibe
I was on my grind all the damn time
When I was away, you was on my mind
Ayy, I gotta do what I gotta do
But I'ma, I'ma come home soon
I'ma come home soon, I'ma come
Ayy, I gotta do, yeah
Ayy, gotta do what I gotta do
I'ma come home, I'ma come home soon
Believe that's true
Ayy

Ooh, why, ooh, why you gotta leave me without some love?
If it's all the same to you
If it's on the way, you know I'm dancin'
Jumpin' out the frame, ooh
I walk in cabanas, ooh, I'ma call my mans, ooh
Dealin' with your cans, hoe, never call my name, hoe
I ain't gotta do this shit, I don't wanna say no
Sippin' on it, drinkin' slow
It take away my pain, yo
It's something that's on the lane, yeah
Then I hear me on the radio, ayy, yeah
I remember, I remember
I remember when you said it was the same
And you wrong, oh no, no, no
But I don't think it all, all the same
No, why
Ahh, why, why-y
Ooh, ooh-ooh
The same thing as before
I know you understand that you in my heart, oh no, no, oh no
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My momma say don't let go
I won't let go when you say you'll come home
I might be going when I say I'll come home
My, yeah, oh yeah, oh, ahh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I don't wanna go now
