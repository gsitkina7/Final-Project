Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that?"
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad (Yes he does)
He remembers all the times that y'all had
He's crying (I'm crying)
That's not okay
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart

Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
So tell me, why, girl? Come on
