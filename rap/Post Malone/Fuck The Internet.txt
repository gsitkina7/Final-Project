A-yeah-yeah-yeah (Ohh)
Whoa-oh-oh
A-yeah-yeah-yeah

I just seen lil' mama Instagram and she flexin'
Don't care about your puppy, just that ass and them breastses
Oh, girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?"
Whoa
The world has gone to shit and we all know that
People freakin' out, like, hit the Prozac
Leon DeChino shorts got all the blogs mad
Well, fuck the internet, and you can quote that, whoa

Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Instalove
And they try so hard just to fuck shit up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

Double the ahh, it's all on your ass, ball on your ass
I ain't gon' be here all night on your ass
I was up grinding, I was all on your ass
Double the cahh, double the bih'
I got 'em up and then y'all in a grit
I bet what's happening, y'all in the dih
I was up buh and all of the dick
Ain't big this big, my favorite shit
She grabbin' my dick, saying "is you shavin' this dick?
Crankin' it bit, then hangin' it bit, duh-buh-buh you hangin' in it?
Came in this bit' but it's say-bih-dih-bih
*gibberish* been taking this dick and then taking this shit
*gibberish* belt
*gibberish* everything I felt
Instagram and shit, dry snitchin' on theyself
Duh-nuh-muh-nuh how you ever felt and I know that
Insta love
Again oh-no-no-no it reminds me of
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't look at the internet no more
Instant love
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah it reminds me of
And, be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't look at the internet no more

Ooh, I know
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Instalove
And they try so hard just to fuck shit up
And I'll prolly be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
