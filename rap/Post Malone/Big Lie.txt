I know, I know

Mustard on the beat, ho

Run it up, run it up
Count it up, count it up
'95 in my cup
Nicotine in my blood
Go on, run it, run it, count it, count it
Go on, show me somethin', ayy, ayy
Go on talkin' that shit, keep on barkin' lil' bitch
Bitches tryna get lit, damn
Ros√© poppin' with the Balmain on me
And I keep on callin' and they know that I don't answer my cell
No, I don't know your mama
I got so much commas, girl, you know I'm only into myself
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie (Oh)

Valet the park on that whip
The Caddy, the '76
My woman gon' box on a bitch
They don't want no part in that shit
I got my money jumpin', I'm proud for ballin' on Fade
Didn't watch the game, you can see that shit on replay
I just drop the top and I pull up to your party
I just grab a Bud and I pop the top on you, pour that water
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah
Say you flexin', that's a big lie

Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

And they know who we are and
And they know that we ballin'

I don't want your bitch, it's only

Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
And they know who we are and
