You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth

I can’t call you right now, I been drinking
And I know that I'll say what I'm thinking
My whole life I was drawn to the deep end
When will it sink in?
Why do I tell myself that I’ll do the best I can?
I know damn well that you couldn't give a damn
Ten billion cuties that think I'm the man
But if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand
Keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's thе one replacing me?
Takе me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)

When we met, you ain't know I was a singer
You weren’t impressed by all the ice on my fingers (So icy)
I had your mom and daddy’s house on my pinky (My pinky)
If I'da known what it’d be like now
I wouldn't be in misery right now
Look in the mirror, I don't see myself
Being with me has gotta be like hell
So tell the devil I'ma be right down

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger, I was caught up in your orbit
Spinnin’ like a bullet (Spinnin' like a bullet)
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's the one replacing me? (Oh)
Take me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
Yeah, I'm wrapped around, and around
And around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You got me wrapped around, and around
And around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh)
I'ma be right down

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger, I was caught up in your orbit
Spinnin' like a bullet (Spinnin' like a bullet)
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Then was shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's the one replacing me?
Take me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
Then was shot back down to Earth
