Oh my God, just take the firearm from me
Holy fuck, I understand that I'm too weak
Oh my God, just shut me up for Heaven’s sake
So I load one 'round, I'm scared to die while I’m awake
So I close my eyes and wait for a miracle
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living
And everything done on a day, goddamn it, that's our decision
I kept my eyes closed, it was easy, now I see it with perfect vision
And everything done for the dead after they're dead, is for the living
Fuck me up, fuck it, get fucked up, hey
Fuck me up, yeah, and stay fucked up
