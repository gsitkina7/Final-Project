I'm on my Kurt Cobain
Feeling like so insane
I got love on the brain, drugs in the vein
And I feel like I can fly
Feeling like so damn good
A little misunderstood
We got love on the brain, drugs in the vein
And I feel like I can fly (Yeah, yeah, yeah, Rich!)

She in awe, trap-jumper, she can't see my mud (No)
Fall up in that pussy, I can't fall in love (Bih)
Out the country I might take ya, syrup, but no maple (No maple)
She think that I'm a player, Bentley seats alligator (Huh?)
Put her on a flight, that's the jet flow (Jet)
I need money, I could find it with my eyes closed (Eyes)
Hit it from the back (Back), I ran up a sack (Sack)
They was hatin' on me, now I'm flexin' just like that (Just like that)
On my boss shit, bought a Gucci suit, bitch (Gucci)
She work three weeks straight to buy an outfit (Huh?)
And I've been ridin' with no roof like I lost it (Like I lost it)
Rich Forever, bitch, on my Rick Ross shit (Yeah)
I'm on my Kurt Cobain
Feeling like so insane
I got love on the brain, drugs in the vein
And I feel like I can fly
Feeling like so damn good
A little misunderstood
We got love on the brain, drugs in the vein
And I feel like I can fly

We'll be blowin' smoke all night (Yeah, yeah)
We'll be goin' broke all night
I'm looking at you through red eyes
Feelin' like Kurt Cobain, Kurt Cobain (Yeah)
