I pulled up a foreign, they told me it's okay
No-no, no, no-no, I never went, no-no
I'm coppin' a four-door, a-dunna-dun-dun-dun
They coppin' them commas, yeah
Now I watch it unfold at the top of that, oh
And I lie on the run, run, run
And I watch it unfold at the top that, oh
And I lie on that run, you mo'fucker

Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
It's something inside of me keeps on givin' in, ayy, ayy
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me 'til my bitter end, ayy
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Something inside of me keeps on givin' in, ayy, ayy
It ain't over, no, it ain't over
No, it ain't over

I pulled up a foreign, they told me it's okay
No-no, no, no-no, I never went, no-no
I'm coppin' a four-door, a-dunna-dun-dun-dun
They coppin' them commas, yeah
Now I watch it unfold at the top of that, oh
And I lie on the run, run, run
And I watch it unfold at the top that, oh
And I lie on that run, you mo'fucker

Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
It's something inside of me keeps on givin' in, ayy, ayy
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me 'til my bitter end, ayy
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Something inside of me keeps on givin' in, ayy, ayy

I don't know how to cop no foreign
I don't know when another man comes
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know when another man comes
And I wanna wonder when the pain will stop
And I wanna wonder when I paid a lot
And I wanna wonder when the pain will stop
Oh, ohh, oh, woah
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
It's something inside of me keeps on givin' in
