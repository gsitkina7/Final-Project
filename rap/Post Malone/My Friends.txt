I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

I lost all my friends, damn, I had to learn the hard way
Started from the bottom, damn right, we came a long way
Talk down on my name, yeah, they try to take it all away
Never had it easy, no, they always made it hard for me
Never gave me shit, had to get my own grip
I ain't perfect, I admit
I kept going, never quit
I provided for my fam, I made sure my dog's ate
Told my shawty 'Bae, I love you, I fuck with you the long way'
I don't need no friends, I'm countin' bands in this new Chanel
Who gon' stick around to the end? Only time will tell
Tried to shoot me down, dig a hole for my funeral
'Said I fall off, little bitch, you delusional

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
Can't apologize, nah, bitch, it ain't no excuse
Where were you when I was down bad, wouldn't give me nothing
People only seem to come around when they need something
You left me in the storm by myself, I was all alone
Diamond cross necklace, hope it only ain't good to my soul
Homies got the judge and got me feeling like Tupac
I heard that's what you gotta go do when you're this sad
I don't need no friends, countin' bands in these YSL's
Throw a couple racks at little shawty 'cause she bad as hell
Diamond audemar on my wrist, it's a two tone
Wait a minute, hold up, who is this? This a new phone

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
