I am crazy, this is for sure (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I am alone, I got nothing no more (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I am not here and this is for sure (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I am not there, I am not anywhere (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded my friend (Ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded, this don't have to end (Ooh, ooh)
But this is the lowest I've ever been in my whole life
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I am broken beyond repair, I ain't going nowhere (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll stay right here until I'm no more, take my light, may be what's in store (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I need someone to help me through, this black abyss so I can say my life is true (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Someone to show me what my life is really worth (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded my friend (Ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded, this don't have to end (Ooh, ooh)
But this is the lowest I've ever been in my whole life (Ooh)
Is it loaded my friend (Ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded, this don't have to end (Ooh, ooh)
But this is the lowest I've ever been in my whole life (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

This one's for you
