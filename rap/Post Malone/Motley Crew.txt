(d.a. got that dope)

Count up the bands stickin' up
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
Came with the gang, a myriad
I seen your whip, hilarious
Where is my roof? Mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior
I get the commas, period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the top of the pyramid
Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
We came to play, are you serious?
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew
Sit up, ball, I just forgot where I was
Pour it up, throw it up, sit up, woah
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
Came with a wig splitter
I got John Wick hitters (Ooh)
I'm a go-get-gеtter (Wow, uh)

Came with the army, army, army, yеah
The people 'round me still the same
We just wanna party, party, party, yeah
We rowdy and won't never change

Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew
What you gon' do? I'ma pull up with the crew
When I'm off the juice, I like to hang out the roof
I'm rockin' jewels, I like when the diamonds, they move
I just go through, I do not wait in the queue
Baby, baby, pinky, Brady, Brady
AP navy, navy, chain like two Mercedes
I'll come when they pay me, come with Katy, Amy
Crew go crazy, crazy, kick it, Dan Bailey (Uh)

Came with the army, army, army, yeah
The people 'round me still the same
We just wanna party, party, party, yeah
