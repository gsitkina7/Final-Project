Oh, yeah
Yeah
Oh, oh
Oh

Ooh, I know, know, know, know
Ooh, don't grow, grow, grow, grow
Ooh, my love, love, love, love
Oh, don't go, go, go, go
Don't go, go, go, go
You know it wasn't over when I said I'm gone
I came right back to you, I
Wasn't over when I wanted
'Cause I ran back to you, yeah, right back to you

You know I had enough when I said I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Ooh, and I said I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
But I don't

Ooh, I know, know, know, know
Ooh, don't grow, grow, grow, grow
Ooh, my love, love, love, love
Oh, don't go, go, go, go
Don't go, go, go, go

Tell me what I want to hear, make it crystal clear
Why you bringing out my fears, bringing out the tears?
The only love I'll ever know is walking down that road
Doin' all my fuckin' worst

You know I had enough when I said I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Ooh, and I said I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
But I don't
Ooh, I know, know, know, know
Ooh, don't grow, grow, grow, grow
Ooh, my love, love, love, love
Oh, don't go, go, go, go
Don't go, go, go, go
