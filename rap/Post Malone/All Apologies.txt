What else should I be? All apologies
What else should I say? Everyone is gay
What else should I write? I don't have the right
What else should I be? All apologies

In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, married
I wish I was like you, easily amused
Find my nest of salt, everything is my fault
I’ll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn, choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, married
Married, married
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
