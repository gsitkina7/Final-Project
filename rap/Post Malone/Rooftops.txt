Let's tell it to the rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to the rooftops, Lets tell it to the rooftops
Let's tell it to the rooftops

Looking at picture frames with thought of dancers and home
Then you looked at me and said I want to be like that
When we're old, when we're old
When we're old
Looking at picture frames with thought of dancers and home

When we're old, when we're old
When we're old
Let's tell it to the rooftops that we have got something new
Let's tell it to the rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to the rooftops, Lets tell it to the rooftops

We don't have time to do all the things that we need

In a week, in a week
In a week
We don't have time to do all the things that we need
Then you looked at me and said I'll be gone in a week
In a week, in a week
In a week
