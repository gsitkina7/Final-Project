There's a man standing on the stairs
And when he breathes, it shakes my structure
I don’t know when and I don't know where
But he says everything will be fine (yeah)

He calls me by my first name
That's funny ’cause I've never seen his face
And then he tells me to live for life
That it all will fall into place
The clouds pass by like a man in a race
That loses control to keep up his pace
There is nowhere that I'd rathеr be than here
With you, my dеar

The gates open and close to a foreign tongue
And the river pushes my eye to an alternate universe
And I may be a giant
But the gates, they are too tall

And I chose to fall for it every time
They give me what I want
But it's never enough

The clouds pass by like a man in a race
That loses control to keep up his pace
There is nowhere that I'd rather be than here
With you, my dear
