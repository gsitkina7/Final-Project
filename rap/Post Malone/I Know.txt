Our love will never be another
You're just a devil undercover (Undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (In the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker, shout out Jonas Brothers
I learned more than I cared to discover (Discover)
Don't you know that I'm more than a come up? (Come up)
You act up and then act like it's nothin' (Nothin')
Sold your soul, you stone cold, you a stunner (Stunner)

Every time you left (Left), shit was never right (Right)
In another bed (Bed) every single night (Night)
Had it to a science (Science), you were so precise ('Cise)
See it in your eyes (Eyes), saw you in the light (Light)
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away (Don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is (Ooh)
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch (Yeah)
Shit could never be like this (Oh)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans (Plans)
Hunnid times you blew another chance (Chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low (Down the low)
Then runnin' back to me in the morning (In the morning)
I know shit could never be like this
You could never be my bitch
No, no
(Oh)

Our love will never be another (Uh)
You're just a devil undercover (Undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (In the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker ('Til I was a sucker, yeah)
Rather be single for life (Single for life, rather be single)
Than be fuckin' with you
I ain't rollin' the dice, no (I ain't rollin' the dice)
I ain't playin' to lose (No)

Every time you left, shit was never right (No)
In another bed (Bed) every single night (Oh)
Had it to a science, you were so precise (Yeah)
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light (Light)
Somehow, mami, I still want you (Want you)
Listen to me, don't drive away (Don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is (Ayy)
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch (Be my bitch)
Shit could never be like this (Be like this)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans (Plans)
Hunnid times you blew another chance (Blew another chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low (Down on the low)
Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this (Be like this)
You could never be my bitch
No, no

Be my bitch
It could never be like this
Shit could never be like this
It could never be like this
