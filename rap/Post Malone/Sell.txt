Memories, why you gotta be so far from me
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't need my life, all I need is to get some sleep tonight
But you making this hard, oh
Oh, you can have what you want
I will sell myself just to make it through
Another day with you
And just the thought of you-ou-ou-ou
Not with me makes me sad
So that's why I just don't think of love
(Oh whoa oh oh oh oh, oh whoa oh oh oh)
Gotta get back to the way it was, back when all we needed was still love
Oh the love, oh
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, I wanna see it fall in place
I never thought this way
But now I got to face the facts that I will never have you back
Oh, you can have what you want
I will sell myself just to make it through
Another day with you
And just the thought of you-ou-ou-ou
Not with me makes me sad
So that's why I just don't think of lov–µ
La, la, la
