Living off expired pride is getting old
And I've been eating precious gems, diamonds and gold
So much that I shine in the moonlight
But in the daytime, I'm never all that bright
I have forgotten that
That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been
Because living off expired pride is getting old
Oh man, it's getting old
And all that is false glows in the dark
But you can nevеr find it when it's lit
You see, it's easy to be somеone you're not
When the someone you're not is all that you got
And you don't want to lose what you have
You have forgotten that
That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been
Because living off expired pride is getting old
It's getting old, yes, it's getting old, yeah
My shadow, shadow is scared of itself
You can see it in its eyes
Its ears are starting to ache from the sound of lullabies
I'm almost hanging on, but when I jump, I just land shy
Of the ledge that I'm aiming for that is way too high
I have forgotten that
I have forgotten that
That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open (The afternoons I spent with you, the nights I prayed that you pull through)
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been (They're everything I gave to you, they're everything I gave to you)
Because living off expired pride is getting old (The afternoons I spent with you, the nights I prayed that you pull through)
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, it's getting old (They're everything I gave to you, they're everything I gave to you)
