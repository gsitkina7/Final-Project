Take my heart and put it somewhere safe (super safe, super safe)
These feet have walked over a few graves (super safe)
I can't see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays
I can’t see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays

You want to put your heart on ice?
You sick of all the lonely nights?
You want to tell me that I ain't ready?
You want to tell me that it ain't right?
You really want to roll them dice?
Remembеr that you saved my life
How can I let you rеally gon' get it?
Sick of the flashing lights
Who are we to know what the future holds?
Who are we to know what we’re letting go of?
Take my heart and put it somewhere safe
Take my heart and store it in a cold, dry place

Take my heart and put it somewhere safe (super safe, super safe)
These feet have walked over a few graves (super safe)
I can't see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays
I can't see you walking away, cause in my world oh everyone stays
Oh...
