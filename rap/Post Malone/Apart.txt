Ripped him apart
Gone for five years
Lose either way
We may not have that far still could break apart

Everything seemed everything was for real
Until that day when they saw a sign

The first one said when you get a new car you love it even if its rusted completely
The next said hold on you just hold on to me while your falling apart
This life may be filled with agony
And people that you love fall apart

Stuck inside an empty home
Stomach is hollow
And Ðµverything is falling apart
We got nothing in common

Is it all right if I let you get my time
If you take it all apart

The first one said when you get a new car you love it even if its rusted completely
The next said hold on you just hold on to me while your falling apart
This life may be filled with agony
And people that you love fall apart

I was caught up in a terrible storm
My wheels were slowly coming apart
Chorus
The first one said when you get a new car you love it even if its rusted completely
The next said hold on you just hold on to me while your falling apart
This life may be filled with agony
And people that you love fall apart

Online, we fall apart
Let me share mine with you
The first one said when you get a new car you love it even if its rusted completely
The next said hold on you just hold on to me while your falling apart

Stuck inside an empty home
Stomach is hollow

Drifting apart, to fall apart
Drifting apart, towards nowhere
I never ever want to be a servant
Having nothing, always want to play the part

While everything around us
Still falls apart
I was caught up in a terrible storm
My wheels were slowly coming apart

Well, that whole fall
I came apart at the seams

Drifting apart, to fall apart
Drifting apart, towards nowhere
I never ever want to be a servant
Having nothing, always want to play the part

Tell me, have you fallen apart?
Say that you want me back

Drifting apart, to fall apart
Drifting apart, towards nowhere
I never ever want to be a servant
Having nothing, always want to play the part

The first one said when you get a new car you love it even if its rusted completely
The next said hold on you just hold on to me while your falling apart
Lose either way
We may not have that far still could break apart

Tell me, have you fallen apart?
Say that you want me back

Why gain some never ending game
When you can take it apart and start over?
Ripped him apart
Gone for five years

I never ever want to be a servant
Having nothing, always want to play the part
I really really want to break free
From everything and everything that keeps us apart

Two hundred hours
That old log cab out on the railroad

Why gain some never ending game
When you can take it apart and start over?
Ripped him apart
Gone for five years

This life may be filled with agony
And people that you love fall apart

Why gain some never ending game
When you can take it apart and start over?
Ripped him apart
Gone for five years

Ripped him apart
Gone for five years
Online, we fall apart
Let me share mine with you

Is it all right if I let you get my time
If you take it all apart

This life may be filled with agony
And people that you love fall apart
Why gain some never ending game
When you can take it apart and start over?

Well, that whole fall
I came apart at the seams
Walking this morning in the rain
Right up to the road again

Everything seemed everything was for real
Until that day when they saw a sign

This life may be filled with agony
And people that you love fall apart
Why gain some never ending game
When you can take it apart and start over?

I was caught up in a terrible storm
My wheels were slowly coming apart

This life may be filled with agony
And people that you love fall apart
Why gain some never ending game
When you can take it apart and start over?

Stuck inside an empty home
Stomach is hollow
And everything is falling apart
Online, we fall apart

I never ever want to be a servant
Having nothing, always want to play the part

Drifting apart, to fall apart
Drifting apart, towards nowhere

Tell me, have you fallen apart?
Say that you want me back
Is there no turning back?
This life may be filled with agony

While everything around us
Still falls apart

Drifting apart, to fall apart
Drifting apart, towards nowhere

And when we weigh me down
You slip and fall apart

Drifting apart, to fall apart
Drifting apart, towards nowhereEmbed
