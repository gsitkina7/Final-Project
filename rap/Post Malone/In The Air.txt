Las Vegas, sorcerers and sages
And the lights turn, turn dark like pages
And Manhattan, demons and dragons
I'm up in the air, where anything can happen

And the city, us and the others
And the city, us and the others

Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me

Seattle, where all the people battle
If the rain pours and bodies wash upon the shore
And Jackson, I walk around without a soul
I lost myself in the museum of rock & roll

And the city, us and the others
And the city, us and the others

Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me


Eldorado, city made of solid gold
Doesn't matter to you all that I left home
I know I've been gone for a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me
Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh it's been a while since I've been gone
All the places I have been
All the people I have met
Oo-oo-oh
I find myself back home again
Oo-oo-oh
