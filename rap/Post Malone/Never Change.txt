Ohh, I swear I'll never change
I swear I'll stay the same
No matter how much that I make

Ohh, I swear I'll never change
I swear I'll stay the same
No matter how much that I make
No matter how much that they hate
Jump out, still saucy
I know they can't stand me, they stare at me
They can't catch me, I'm too damn fast
I'ma hop out that bird to the Seven Series
I can see the money with a blindfold
Every joint I'm on, bitch, I gotta go
I remember sleeping in my buddies home
Now them hunnids in the rubber, bitch, it won't fold

Bitch, you so cold, I'm so cold, ooh
Bitch, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
One motherfucker tryna play me like a console
No way, no way
I just got to get that check today
No way, no way
I just got to get that check today
Ooh, ooh
I just got to get that check today
Ooh, ooh
I just got to get that check today


Bitch, you so cold, I'm so cold, ooh
Bitch, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
One motherfucker tryna play me like a console
No way, no way
I just got to get that check today
No way, no way
I just got to get that check today
Ooh, ooh
I just got to get that check today
Ooh, ooh
I just got to get that check today
