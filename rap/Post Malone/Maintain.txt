Good job, 1st

I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I just bought a new chain, I never change up
And I'm rockin' Balmains and I got Margiela
And I step in on the saw, bitch, I got out better

And your bitch is so fly, ain't got no propeller
I been leakin' water, and it's no propeller
Never planned to ball, but I got my bread up
When I'm ballin', so wet, you need a umbrella, ayy
I'm too young to be in the club, ho
I ain't tryna step on no, no toes
Diamonds flashin' like they takin' photos
Every single jaw drop when I walk through
Tryna maintain, and get my paper
I just bought a new chain, I get the check up
And I'm rockin' Balmains and I got Margiela
And I step in on the saw, bitch, I got out better

I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
Just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper

And we pourin' champagne on your bitch
We be countin' money while we get lit
I'm just countin' up 'til I'm rich, yeah
Ayy, I'm just throwin' bands where my wrist is
I be throwin' up bands 'til I get sick
And I'm watchin' money fall from the ceilin'
Everything that I say, I don't mean it, hey
I don't even wanna touch you bitch
They don't get paid like I do
Swervin' in the car, 4-2
I just got a bottle and I got my money
We gon' go for bottle, come on, come on
Tryna maintain, and get my paper
I just bought a new chain, I get the check up
And I'm rockin' Balmains and I got Margiela
And I step in on the saw, bitch, I got out better

I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
Just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper

Oh, hello, hello
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Wanna play, I do
Mm, mm, mm
