Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?

Countin' up bands, and so my neck froze
Runnin' outside and cop a mafro
Rollie on now we're back and now my neck froze
Runnin' outside, I'm another one
Was he all up in it, count another one
Was he in the pussy and am I on?
Here's enough money, let's ball
Here's enough money, let me throw
Drive a Rolls Royce Wraith, that's my everyday
And the money, it falls, then we come away
There's some money now, sippin' on my ice, ayy
There's some money and you might just get your ass kicked, but
Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?

Diamonds on me water like they know the call
And I want a 40 and you know the call
It's some in a 40 and you know the call
It's a money 40, that's the protocol
And oh, woah, girl it shouldn't make sense
Since I got my own 40-automatic
And oh, woah, girl, it shouldn't make sense
Send the money with the 40 on the side
Yeah, ayy, let me know, tell me how she go
Put it on my bands and the 20 on my truck
Don't slow me up, baby, slow me up
Diamonds on my bed, she can see them on me matter
You wanna run up on me, but it still ain't happen
Was somewhere on her body, and she's still a mack
He's a run up on me, but it still ain't happen
I remember back in Stoney and I'm in a mansion

Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?
Ball out my fatty, she call me daddy
See mama fatty, she pop them Xannies
I don't want nothin', see mama fatty
It's on my doney and on my baby
I don't want no-one, want another one
Pistol and her pussy help me though
I don't want no-one, that's the one I want
I don't want no pussy, let me go

Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?
