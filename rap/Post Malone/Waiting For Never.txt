Should've seen the signs, so I guess I deserved it
Made a habit overlookin' cracks in the surface
Goin' along with the bullshit you sold me
What was I to do when the bottle stopped working?
Try to make a home out a house while it's burning down
Burn it to the ground

Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, "Sit down, man, shut the fuck up"
You put me through hell but I can't get enough
It took a little while, baby, then I woke up
Woah, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in thе same place
I keep tellin' mysеlf if I wanted you to change
I'd be waitin' for never, waitin' for never
Yeah, you coulda done a better job at hiding your intentions
I know what you did, stop bein' so defensive
Save it, when did you become so jaded?
I'd seen so many come and go, then come back to me
I'll never ever let another take half of me
I can't win, and still, I chase it

Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, "Sit down, man, shut the fuck up"
You put me through hell but I can't get enough
It took a little while, baby, then I woke up
Woah, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in the same place
I keep tellin' myself if I wanted you to change
I'd be waitin' for never, waitin' for never

Just look right at my face
Yeah, you should stay away
There's nothin' left to fake
There's nothin' left to take

Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, "Sit down, man, shut the fuck up" (Shut the fuck up)
You put me through hell but I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
It took a little while, baby, then I woke up
Woah, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in the same place
I keep tellin' myself if I wanted you to change
I'd be waitin' for never, waitin' for never (Waitin' for never, for never)
