I gotta start off right
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey, ooh, ooh

Hunnid bands on the floor, don't matter
It’s like it don't matter
Hunnid bands on the floor, don't matter
It’s like it don't matter
It's like it don't matter
It's like it don't matter
Like it don't matter
Hunnid on the mantle
Something's going on 
At the fall, oh, no
Hey, hey
It’s like it don’t matter
It's like it don’t matter
It's like it don't matter 
This song, this song
It's like it don’t matter at all
Hunnid bands 
It's like it don't matter
It's like it don't matter to ya
It's like it don't matter to ya
I feel the suffering inside
It's like it don't matter to ya
I feel the suffering inside
It's like it don't matter
It's like it don't matter
It's like it don't matter
Inside, it's time to pay
It's time, it's time to pay
You take your time
Like it don't matter
Like it don't matter
Like it don't matter
Like it don't matter
It's time to pay
It's time to pay
Hey, hey
It's time to pay
