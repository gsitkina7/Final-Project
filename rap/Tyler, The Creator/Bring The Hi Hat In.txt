Nigga know me, I'm a gangsta
Stab babies, I'm a crip
Wearin' red, blue flag on my tag
Wearin' thongs my jeans sag
Nigga, bring that mothafuckin' synth in
Shit, my girlfriend like white men
That's why I keep white friends
I'm in a Buick, my homie in a white Benz
Nigga bring the high hat in
Nigga bring the high hat in
Nigga bring the high hat in
Nigga bring it, uh

We wearin' Bapes on our mothafuckin' toes

Got no hair cut with no damn headline

Oh, nigga take the high hat out
Put your dick in, take the high hat out
Put your hat hat all up in my damn mouth
Take the high hat out now we headed down south
We headed up north with them horses
Eatin' hay 'cause we ain't got Porsches
We don't do nothin' but this
All up in your granny tub eatin' grits
In the kitchen
Nigga I'm crippin'
Don't ask me what I'm doin' if I'm limpin'
That mean that cripple is simple
Like this beat is simple
Bitch with the weave, come over here (Uh)
Bitches with real hair gotta go (Ah)
