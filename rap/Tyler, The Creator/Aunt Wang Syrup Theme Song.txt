I can't wait to take you home
I've been waiting all day to heat you up
Cover you in butter
Then I'ma drown you in syrup
Go (HEY!)

I'm gonna eat you alive
I'm gonna eat you alive
Woah, you and I
(Come one baby)
I'm gonna eat you alive
Now you're gone
Eat you alive
I'm gonna eat you alive
Gone, gone, gone
You're already gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone
And I'm gone
And I'm gone
Aunt Wang will be my favorite forever
I eat it, I drink it, I breathe it
I’m down for whatever
You fuck with that bullshit
But I know that Aunt Wang’s is better
