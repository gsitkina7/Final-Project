I got that Alexander the Great type imperial flow
Butterfingers, I’m droppin’ bars like my signal was low
A car full of Os, looking like the cereal bowl
You hear me everywhere
(I'm everywhere)
But I ain't stereo though
I heard they waiting on my downfall
They talking again
Shit, I tell em' "fall back" like it's autumn again
I know they waiting for my reply, but that's all they'll get
I got my mind on bigger shit
Tell them adios then
I'm doing this for the niggas before me
Life's a bitch but god forbid that bitch divorce me
Fucking with these and one hoes they quick to cross me
They found out the hard way I guess they lost me
I'm feeling quite bossly now
I don't need love
Walking on air with my feet up a thousand feet up
I've been telling those to speak up because the money talking
It's hard to hear with all these hundreds talking
Everyday I be shining ask the weather man
Now it's girls on my jock like a Letterman
I just do it the best
If that means I'm doing better than
Then fuck it, whatever then all day
BrandUn DeShay
I'm chillin' with the homies
Real talks, real conversations
Most of y'all speaking on what girl that nigga dating
I only speak to her and she say she facing
I hope she ain't got braces
Make her keep going til' I tell her she amazing
Casey keep spittin got these haters walking mazes
I used to play games now I'm playing for the payment
Born in '93 with my girl from the '80s
I just say it again to them
Lotta niggas try to stop me but I ran through them
Lotta niggas didn't believe I wave my hands to them
Now everybody know exactly what the man doing
Ro-man music pump it loud, go ahead and make it grand to it
I just grab my pen and pad and let my hands do it
It's Odd Future til' I stop you heard my first music
Now when you come and see me rock bring a hurse to it
You niggas

Ignorant, Atheist, sound like a fucking monster
Tall, skinny, lanky, buck it, fuck it, badass posture
Copped some angel wings in Hell, where they discounted
Mounted with the devil, he was formal with some Polo and some Dockers
Dancing with him, playing vintage Cindi Lauper
With some Crips in all red, like they playing Red Lobster
My bitch is white Italian to be exact, mobster is her father
And he'll kill me when he finds out I'm reading her Harry Potter
Fuck him, I'm a demon, fill your daughter up with semen
With Supreme embroidered logos, making fun of homos
Cause it's funny
Tommy rugby Hilfiger, screaming nigga with a cluck
I'm a fuckin' Nazi with a condom, barely give a fuck
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Fuck Lame, 91'
We hockey fuckin' awesome, hit you with the Wolf Gang puck
Trucks thunder, now she's in the trunk
Wondering why she's 'bout to get raped and chopped up, lumber
He said write a sixteen, well she was seventeen
And I'm only eighteen and that's statutory rape
And if you fucking snitch on me I guess I'll make the great escape
To have a date with your dead body and I cannot be late
Might do a Ted Bundy, I can consider ya'll some haughtys
If they find me at my home, guess I gotta fucking roam
All alone in the streets, gotta hustle drugs for food
Gotta sell beats for clothes if I really wanna eat
Fuck you, O.F.M. Bangin' on your mothafuckin' FM
Fuck Tammy
Fuck Tammy
