Ayo
Never gave a fuck about a nigga or his feelings
Or his momma, or opinions (Woo)
Or his cousin, or appearance or his dead grandmama
Fuck designer, fuck his 
Treat opinions like a orange colored  I'm peelin' off
I can't even name it, 500 grand and I paint it if I didn't
Man, fuck it if I didn't and I probably bought a lemon fruitcake
I put cucumber colored bombs in it, shit is material
It's not that serious, how to live stress-free I'm the fuckin' 
Birthdays, holidays, please don't call me, I always leap froggy
I don't get anxiety, I just go, when you just go
