Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell Molly and Mary and other various items
One time, one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead, tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short: he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding

Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high (Tryna get high)
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Task force poured into my fortress (Fortress)
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms, and
They found a couple portraits on the porch
Hope they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties, and we was raging, I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin, cotton, leather, and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake 'cause it's good, I mean, I would if I could
But I like playing dress-up and mix-match
Sorry, I'ma 'fess up: You aren't getting your kids back

Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high

Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side

What's in my trunk?
White, girl
What's in my trunk?
White, girl
You need a warrant, officer (Officer)

You could say I kill 'em if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug 'em down
It's pretty disgusting
Finger-crush your face, I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs
Cook you in the oven, yeah
