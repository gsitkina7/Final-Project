D.a got that dope
Yeh, Yeh, Gone!

Man, all these times
Haven’t seen one yet
I haven’t wanted this
If I wanted to skit
I’ll Devour to my lady
Fuckin, that is crazy
I’ll be going to the lock
To hug you in the dark
C’mon man
Right in my city
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

Man loving the dark
A great thing to hard
Personal Donkey in the start
I’ll Devour to my lady
Fuckin, that is crazy
I’ll be going to the lock
To hug you in the dark
