When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I’m a piece of shit, it ain’t that hard to fuckin’ tell
Blogs say I’m the shit, but I can’t detect the smell
Haven’t tried to be successful, cause I’m afraid to fail
Wearing all yellow, now I'm praying to the Devil
And I dig my own ditch and I brought my own shovel
Coffin on my arms, fuck, lame on my wrists
And nobody gave a fuck, I thought Sarah would give a hint
Fuck Commercial, my show would never be a hit
But I had dreams of being able to fuck every bitch
That could breathe, that got knees, with a twat, I myself
Fuck a chain, fuck swag, fuck a prop, period
Make my own rules, fuck a cop
You niggas with these one-sided visions, cyclops over my blocks bridging
Stitching up Sarah name like it was my cling to fame
In retrospect, O.F. is a fucking game
We terrorizing old folks, smoke, skates, rape sluts that chew dick
Run around, grab a new inhaler like I’m not sick
But I’m not bitch, counselors tell me all my issues like I’m not it
Demented, in my own demension
Couple “Fuck you”’s and donuts is my devision
Chopping up my wrist with incisions, no second decisions
Creator of shit with no inventions, look
Tryna get the headless to listen, but I can’t
Because I’m my own fuckin’ religion
And they think I’m tryna be different
But I don’t give a shit like sitting down pissing
I’m a black panther in white skin, like a lesbian who like men
Fuck friends, I don’t even know how to begin
Well this is the beginning of new ends
