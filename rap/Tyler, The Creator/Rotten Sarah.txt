Cold blood
Green eyes with a mute body full of old drugs
Dead body laying next to Sarah, we're finally together
Truthfully, I kinda like this a little better
Now we floating our spirits the dead, you can hear it
You call her stands up when you're near it
You can feel it on your mark, see it in the dark
Homicidal, I never had a fucking heart
And she tried to tear us apart
She beg me to stop and I didn't even start (Sarah)
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
In this book of love, seen the look of her face
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
In the book of love, you should have seen the look on her face
And Sarah stays rotten in my base

Sarah
Forever
Tyler, The Creator
I love you
