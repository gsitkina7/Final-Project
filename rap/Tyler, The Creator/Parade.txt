My music
My mind
And them three sixes

Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)
Welcome to the euphoria of cocaine without Abel
I can make music that makes sense, but not mentally stable
Eighteen, with the whole world in front of me
Odd Future teenagers, nobody can fuck with we

Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)
Odd (I'm not yet a man)

I scream and jump around on couches while you sit and talk
I skip to places, smiley faces, while you fucking walk
My TV stays on Cartoon Network, fuck that "Twilight" shit
You have highlights about your life, I have life 'bout my highlights, bitch
Go to college, get a job, marry, have a kid
Watch them grow, and then you die? No, nigga, fuck the system

Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)
Good kids make bad grown-ups
Stay gold, stray old, maturing means that your life sucks
In my wolf suit, I roam where the wild things at
Still growing, still learning, not knowing that I'm Max
I don't want to grow up, I know that shit for a fact
Nigga, eighteen

Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)
Odd (I'm not yet a man)

They say I'm immature; I say that they depressed
I talk to unicorns; I'm wearing a uniform
Of a nigga that don't give a fuck about time
You live your life all serious while I'm enjoying mine

Wow, that's— That's a really good way to look at it
Yeah I mean... I don't. I mean I'm really hyper and everything with my imagination
Ohh okay—ADHD?
I'm not having ADHD like, one second, I'm real hype as fuck, but the next minute, I can just slow that shit down
