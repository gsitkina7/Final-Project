Good day, Sir Baudelaire, what can I do for you?
Oh, dude, I am so fucking hungry, and I just want to eat
Can I get the, can I get the brown sugared salmon?
Mkay, so our dinner plates this evening are the braised bohemian beef or the brown sugared salmon
Heh, yeah, I know, I want, I want the brown sugared salmon please
With the, with the potatoes, and I don't, I don't want brussels sprouts
Mmm, I'm so sorry, we are out of that
The chef actually ran out of salmon because there was a trivial boat shortage at the lake so-
So why did you mention it in the first place?
Because that's our specials
Okay, alright, cool
Let me just get the ehm, the braised bohemian beef with the potatoes, and I don't-
Oh, Mr. Baudelaire, I'm gonna have to check if we have the braised bohemian beef
Are you fucking dumb?
I'm just gonna have to double check that we have that
Who's- who's running this place? Who's in charge here?
I'm in charge Mr. Baudelaire, and thank you so much for traveling with us
Is there a dilemma I can sort out?
I'm starving, and I just want dinner
Oh, well, our dinner specials are the braised bohemian beef, and the brown sugared salmon
I know, I fucking know, and this lady keeps on telling me that-
Oh, ah, my name's Trina, sir
Okay, well, Trina Sir, keeps saying "It's no salmon, it's no beef, it's no anything, I just want-
It's not "No anything" Mr. Baudelaire, it's the braised bohemian beef or the brown sugared salmon
I think he's leaning towards the beef
Trina, would you quadruple check if we have the beef?
Yes
Mmmm, we do not have the braised bohemian beef
Oh jeez, I'm so sorry Mr. Baudelaire, I have just got word, that we are in fact out of the braised bohemian beef
But, we are now serving complimentary yogurt
Now, would you like strawberries or granola?
Oh-oh, oh, we are out of the yogurt
