Fucking Opposite Day, yeah, my heart beat slower
When we would hold hands in the back of lawn's mower
The blood pressure going to my penis got lower, like some nigga kids testing for diplomas
Dreams about you spitting like a llama in the fucking Odd Futurama where your last name would be Okonma
And where you deepthroating different pieces, I'm sorry, but you're my fantasy, you're sicker than a herpe in a coma
This is what I'm known for
Ready? (Uh) We can get it hot and sweaty like a musty toaster in the posters of you on my wall with the mouth cut out
So I have paper cuts on my balls by the fucking time that I pull out
Life is what you shit out
'Cause if I can't have you in the right way, I'm going left, and I doubt that that's a good route
Pleasure's either or, so if you're not a whore, it's no worries, I can kill you and masturbate with your blouse (Scream)
Go ahead, scream, shout
'Twas was the night before we made love, not a creature was breathing, not even a damn mouse
'Twas was the night before we made love, not even a damn mouse
(Scream)
Alright

Hello, I'm Wolf, not even on any raping shit, 'cause there's a million fucking ways that I can make you take this dick
Make you sick, and force you in a long term relationship
And with that said, let's begin with head, you brainy bitch
Three sixes like Gacy Dick diary, I got a bunch of kids inspiring to be an athiest
I'm hiring a bunch of fucking demons to do crazy shit
It's tiring when all these fucking Christians are just hating shit (The irony)
Um, what's to live for? Ten whores?
Canon Cams to film hardcore porn in the back of Supreme Stores?
Skateboard with four more niggas in the same shit?
Cult lead this earth, with the same niggas I came with
Bang with the Wolf Gang, fuck trust, 'cause in the end you'll find out you've all been fucking the same bitch
And that's life, motherfucking thrust her shit
Life's a bitch, I'm just trying to find a trunk to lock her in

Damn
