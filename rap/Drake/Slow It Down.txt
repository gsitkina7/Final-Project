Hey girl
Do you want my number?
That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will
Drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner
I don't expect nothin' at all

But what if we happen to kiss?
Then we touch?
Put a rush on it and get it over with
Or what if I just know
What you like and it feels right
Then it's over with
What if I don't call you back?
Prove you right
All this last's, just one night (Maybe we should slow it down, slow it down)
Slow, slow, slow
Hey girl
I'm back in Atlanta
Second dates are lovely
This time you should choose were we go
Need suggestions
How about the movies?
Mini-Golf or ice cream?
I'm not picky, you let me know

But what if we happen to kiss?
Then we touch?
Put a rush on it and get it over with
Or what if I just know
What you like and it feels right
Then it's over with
What if I don't call you back?
Prove you right
All this last's, just one night (Maybe we should slow it down, slow it down)
Slow, slow, slow

But what if we happen to kiss?
