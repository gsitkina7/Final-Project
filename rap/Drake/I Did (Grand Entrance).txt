Yeah
Yeah, ayy

It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with Fee, if I'm down in Baton
Link with Tez, link with Zhii, when I'm down in Jackson
Just got back, overseas I was the main attraction
This ain't them, this is me, so you know what's crackin'
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"

And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute

I mean maybe I'm confused, 'cause I thought that we was enemies, yeah
The big you is like a mini me
Like BIG U, man, I'm a legend in my city streets, yeah
Niggas peep, I wrote this shit while I was whippin' streets
Like fuck the law, I dropped Adonis off and pick a beat, yeah
Ballin' by the beach, like Miami Heat, yeah
Presidential suites, we don't get impeached
I talked to God standin' up straight, I don't get on my knees
That isn't me, that's not the person I was raised to be
Just wait and see

Shit is jumpin' in my bank account
You know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute
