Wheezy outta here
Ayy

This ain't no regular shit
We never beggin' for shit
Niggas is ready to quit
Shit that they hate to admit
In Texas, I keep a rifle inside of the whip
Call it drivin' a stick
In Vegas, I get two million a night
From the Wynn, just to run through the hits
All that on top of the chips
Cash 'em all out, then I dip
Bet on fifteen 'cause of Nip
My pocket get blue like a Crip, ayy
What a slime to be alive
You don't want problems with the guys
She wanna come through just to vibe, well
We got different things in mind, well
London been treatin' me very well
Whole lotta chocolate and caramel
I cannot drive to the hotel
Might end up sleepin' in Annabel's
Summer, all I did was rest
New Year's, all I did was stretch
Valentine's Day, I had sex
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
What a time to be a slime, uh
Hit that pussy from behind, huh
What a time to be a slime, uh
Flipped it up and left a lime (Slatt, slatt), uh
What a time to be a slime
Niggas bitter when they ain't in they prime
What a time to be a slime
Niggas get rich, they say you droppin' dimes

This ain't no regular shit
I don't take regular shits
I could go Michael or Prince
Or I could keep the score how it is
I took a trip to the Ritz
I took advantage of the bitch
I told her to feed me some grits
Then I put on my shoes, and I dipped
If niggas tell you they fuckin' with me
I'ma gon' tell you that's caninini'
Opps say I'm never knowin' where that they be
Bitches be sayin' they always see me
I took two years off and now I'm OD
Rappers just thought it was over for me
Christmas, I bought her the flawless AP
Didn't read the caution and now it's elite
Moshpit, mob shit, mobster, rob shit
I go brazy in a mosh pit, pop opp shit, yeah
Mobster, Rastafari
I consume garden, lotta weed, follow me, yeah
Sex, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
