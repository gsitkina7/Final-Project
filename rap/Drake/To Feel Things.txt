Wild things you're doing at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doing it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as the real thing

You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
What are you doing lately?
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me

I can't recover from all this conversation
You called me weak and you testing my manhood as we yell at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you just to show you I love you
Just know I can jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you said, despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You acting out, you know you love to see a young nigga suffer

You, you, you know, know, know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over

That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me
