Say you want my company
Sometimes I feel so naive
I don't wanna give up on you easy
Things aren't easy, I agree
Why you wanna be this cold to me
Why you wanna make me make believe
Things aren't what they seem
And it got too deep girl, too deep
It's a problem
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened, I go silent
I wouldn't even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me

Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes
Now you wanna mention me
Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made
Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like you’re bored of me

Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means

My yiy's too fried (Ayy)
All these thoughts in my mind
Motives too transparent for me
I know you don't care about me
Dealing with me like some wasteman
You think I live in the palm of your hand
I'm too understanding and patient (Patient)
Lightning might've stricken you right where you stand (Ooh)
And your karma, karma's gonna be a problem
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened I go silent
I wouldn't even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me

Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes
Now you wanna mention me
Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made
Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like you’re bored of me

Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means

She dey play with my energy, nonstop
You realize that you messing with a gangsta
Oh girl worry 'bout your karma
Tired everyday a lil' drama
If you wanna leave, just leave, no pressure
If you wanna leave, just leave, no pressure
No, no, no pressure
I will miss ya
If you wanna leave, just leave, no pressure
No pressure at all
(Another banger)
My girl you whine
Make you dance
Make you move like a rasta
Move dirty wine
Make you dance like a dancer
Give me dirty dance
Like you do, belly dancer
My girl you whine
Make you dance
Make you move like a rasta
Move dirty wine
Make you dance like a dancer
Give me dirty dance
Like you do, belly dancer
