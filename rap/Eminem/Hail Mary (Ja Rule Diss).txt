Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12-gauge shotty (Feel me!) (Come get me)
And Ja said he shall be (Motherfuckers if you want Shady)
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac (If Pac was still here now)
To lead this industry into the ways of the man (He would never ride with Ja)
Follow me! (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Keep my mesh vest as Pac's vest

Come get me
If you muthafuckas want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearin' rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted
In The Source, stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to God, hopin' no one's listenin'
See 50 comin' for me, oh my god, ma—my position
No one'll pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
And now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin' madman who screams
Like I'm Pac, but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin' muthafuckas names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucka

Come get me
Motherfucker if you want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Get off that E
'Fore you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked

Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit muthafucka, we ballin'
Catch me countin' cheese and when I'm callin', can you accept my call
C.O. let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Muthafuckas thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talkin' 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin', bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me black
You's a muthafuckin' punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scarin' them fuckin' kids with your ugly ass mug (Ha-ha-ha)
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don’t play that
All these old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man (Ha-ha)
Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryna play hate on my shit, man, eat a fat dick
Lovin' this shit that's how you made me
Feelin' like I got you niggas crazy (Uh-uh)
Against all odds, hopin' my thug muthafuckas know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute
Bitch!
I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involvin' me for
It's been a long time comin', like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc. roster
Dumbass, now who's shootin'? Ah made you look
You said Bus singin' the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shootin', I take a look at your man
The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga, start adjustin' your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate tryin' to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
You finished, I ain't tryin' to repeat this
Just cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

Oh shit, it was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue, homie
Now I'ma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
Hahaha, BITCH! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac, motherfucker, hahaha
2Pac shoes too big for you to walk in you lil' faggot, hahaha
(What do we have here now?)
