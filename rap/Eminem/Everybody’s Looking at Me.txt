Lights, action, cameras flashin'
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashin'
Flashin'
Type who might throw his underwear in the trash like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axle Rose
White version of Shaft, pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a Mac, jet black limo
Stretch so far back, can't see the back windows
Steppin' out, pink hats, furs and minks
Chick on each arm, what the **** you think?
Right arm got that kid from *NSYNC's chick on it
Left arm got that little P!nk chick on it
Me and Dre at the VMA's again
Pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again
A'ight, dawg (Haha), you want war? 
You beatin' us—not a chance
Let me show you what the clip does
'Cause D12 is harder than virgins inside strip clubs
Yo, we bust thugs
You beatin' us is like twenty inch  on Love Bugs:
It won't happen,  satisfaction
 I got you backspin
Actin' like you harder than life
Ayo, yo, we smarter 
Peace to Obie Trice, rock a mic, it's only right
Ob' Trice  around the globe twice
How it feel with DeShaun chosen words
Peace to Mark Labelle, Flex and Paul Rosenburg
Yo, Em-Diddy save me
Ayo, I think my dad's gone crazy

My head hits the pillow, a weepin' willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep sayin' it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playin' it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
Shit yeah, I'm a basket case
And I mastered this rap s*** 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some **** infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—
A'ight, dawg, you involved with a hog
That'll spit a bar like a brick of raw
Get you off like porn tricks, born with natural ability
To put both hands up on the Statue of Liberty
Smackin' an iller me with accurate agility
Attack your facility then it's back to my killin' spree
Jigga, Nelly is cool, it's the wack ones that's killin' me
While Clinton got head, I was in the sack with old Hillary
The fact I'm an ill MC strapped with artillery
I got your family at your funeral clappin' with misery
I can happen to him or me, better the other way
Pillow  watch her suffocate
You're hard, Doody,  for D12 (Haha)
 Funk Flex, more noise than a seashell
Y'all faker than , we big in Dallas
We unsigned without the hype back before Rick Morales
Put it down there, rip your lungs with talons
Y'all lack talents, in fact, you're all off balance
I'ma say it like this: you're short like 
And just tune in to  show on June 4th
