Blastin' off (Aw yeah!)
Yo, I'm sayin' though
You understand what's going on right now, London?
One two, one two, one two (Yeah)
One two, one two, one two (One two)
Y'all done started something that you can't undo (What?)
Yo, yo (A one-one-one two)

I'm up in the spot with Tim Westwood
You wanna step to this? You better use your best foot
Flawless freestyles I drop right off the top (Yeah)
Take a bottle of beer and bite off the top (Yeah)
Right of the block, straight to your neighborhood (What?)
The flavor's good in London and I'ma stay for good (Ha!)
Yo, check it out, it's Slim Shady
I rip the radio right off of the S baby (Yeah)
Y'all can't see me 'cause y'all don't wanna even be it
Y'all don't understand these freestyles when I MC it (Yeah)
Original bad boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace (What)
I lace the weed with insect repellent, better check to smell it
Eminem starts with E, better check to spell it
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped on my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was 6 months
And said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns (Yeah)
I kick you in the tummy until you're sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it (What?)
And all the gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, I don't feel it (Yeah)
And any MC that try to step to this I'll throw you right off of the roof
Ayo, bust it, Proof!
Hey listen
One of a kind and I come with the time
Havin' fun with the rhyme until I'm done with your mind
Listen, now every MC got a story
Well, mine is me and my story hasn't involved me before me
I'm sorry too when my style to be proved
Ayo since Big Daddy Kane fell off they don't know how to be smooth
Yo, I seen a fat rodent walk in with Paul Rosen
With a gat in holdin', talkin' 'bout he DeShaun Holton
It's the same thing, we bust when it come through
With Tim Westwood, your best foot forward
Can't do that, here it is, put your good foot
We mack y'all, like y'all was some hoes on Wood wood
No time for that, flatbacks when you rap, counterattack
With a battle axe, you collapse from them whack raps
You try to spit to me, I make you all know I'm a genius
If I hear hyenas
Come back holdin' my―yo, no need to cuss, bust (Penis!)
Yo we can't say that keep it the cleanest, the meanest
Slim Shady, next single was "My Fault"
Y'all caught outlined in chalk, incredible as the Hulk
While I settle for swart, it's the P-R-letter O
Sex is hetero, cash more checks than federal, you better know
How you feel about they got a dope cheddar flow
And my man Dee Teezy, straight from Stress magazine
Bag a scene, we drag your queen
Like she's a man dressed up, how you feel you get pressed up
Left up, it's time for that P-R-O-O, you get F'd up
Yeah it's time for that mind combat
Next up my man Slim Shade when we rhyme at
Last night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed (What)
Shucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I've called in to work 'cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be (Yeah)
Give me 11 Excedrin and my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine (Woo)
Scratched my balls 'til I shred the skin
Doctor check this rash, look how red it's been
It's probably AIDS, forget it then (Ha ha)
I'll strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense like dykes usin' dildos
So reach in your bill folds for 10 duckets
And pick up the Slim Shady stuff that's on Rawkus (Yeah)
Somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin', I can't read it (I got your back)
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it (I got your back)

Ayo, the truth hurt when Proof hurt
Move the whole Earth beneath your feet just like loose dirt
So F your politics if you swallow, feel the hollow tips rip
Through your collar disc, learn your knowledges
Then burn your colleges, I touch your grill
With the skill of a dermatologist, your turn to follow this
Acknowledge this head cracker, ho smacker
Whack rapper attacker, internet hacker
No slacker, best factor, Midwest bracket
Yeah, you know about it, it's us on your jacket
DJ Headscratcher like a hatchet, who can match it?
Make you go-go like Gadget, perform magic
Without a wand, I drop bombs without Saddam
A vet' without 'Nam, I make sense without common ground
I'm still down y'all with my first crew
You got a fly style, I down that just like curfew
Yo, I'm worth two ears and a mind full of attention
Plus I'm CEO of the whack MC prevention
Listen to a real gift over ill riffs
'Cause you on the mic, me and Slim ain't tryna hear like Will Smith
Your career's not over with, come here to cope a spit
We heat the sub y'all before the supernova hit
I know the truth, so now I’m baring all
I made R. Kelly confess he stole his first style from Aaron Hall
A whack MC with a gun, I'm not one
And when see Kurt Cobain tell him "bring back my shotgun"
I got one style for all y'all bazooka
Ayo, if I was 2Pac, I'd come back from Cuba
Rhyme with me when I push on her tooters
Tryna get wild and then we bust like Lugers
Me and my man Slim Shady, we pen great-y
Take our 80 MC's, you know West what, what
What, what, what
What
Aight, aight
Yo, yo yo (Yeah)
One more time I come back
Slingin' the wack, yo
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth for a roll of quarters (Woo)
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a messed up childhood, that I use as an excuse
And ain't nothin' changed, I kept the same mind state
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You'll probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it (Yeah)
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Pfft, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Forget it, you only live once you might as well die now

Yeah, best the way it is
Roll your tape recorders, we came to the London borders
Walk in a caster store, put on a master score
Blast your four, then I trash your store
Your woman start to scream so I stab your whore
Jet out your door faster than a Labrador
Yeah, yeah

Smokin' herb and still we spit
On this microphone, they say I'm allowed to say, "shit"
So I'ma say it as much as I can
'Cause it don't matter 'cause I'm the man
With a frickin' beer in my hand
I said, "frick" 'cause I was respectin' Tim Westwood
Y'all wanna step to this, yo I come from the best hood
Detroit, the Motown, where it goes down
Kick the flow sound, rappers they know now
But kick a pro now

Ayo
Back and forth, me and Em don't need to practice
Y'all lack this, we stick you like a cactus
You scream like a actress, the fact is
Y'all can't see us in '99, 2000
3000, 4000 arousin' styles

And 3 plus, y'all wanna be us
But none of y'all can see us (What)
Even if y'all had some new bifocals, I try locals
So y'all die roiled locals 'cause I smoked you (Yeah)
Plus I provoke you and then I bust
Freestyles y'all can't trust, I'm like Canibus (Yeah)
I bust, can I bust? No, you can't
Well, yes I can 'cause I'm Slim Shady and I'm the man

Ayo
We flex styles like a bicep
I found out where Canibus' money went
I borrowed a dollar from Wyclef
Rhyme deaf MC's need to try this
You can't get with this, make you on the minus
Plus that, we bust back, yo F that
Rap that, step up and get flat
And it's time for y'all to hear what's this year's around
Detroit been quiet long enough
Ayo Slim, I need you to back me up
My freestyles ain't connectin'
They let 'em start respectin'
We disrespectin'

Well, I'ma check then with dirty needles
It's two of us but we're not the Beatles
'Cause there was three of them, and I am seein' them
But y'all ain't seein' Em even if I was drivin' in the BM in the PM
With the top up and the top down, don't matter 'cause I rock now
Yo, y'all can hear the Glock sound, 2Pac now
Yo, that's what I am when I bust, this lyrical image
Y'all can't just betray the scrimmage
That I be killin' when I be bustin' and I'm crushin'
Any MC leave 'em with no freakin' discussion

Run up in your house then I shot your wife
Ayo Em, hold these Tylenol 3's while I rock the mic

Weed lacer, ninety-seven burgundy blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury Tracer
I'm on some loc' shit, some fed up with this bein' broke shit (Yeah)
I'm not to joke with, yo, I don't sell crack, I smoke it

Aight?
Blastin' off, aight?
We blastin' off right now, London!
Tim Westwood baby, you don't understand right now!
We bombin' the whole land on some Vietnam shit, yo!
Where we spawn yo! Yeah
Blast off
You understand what's going on right now, London?
You don't understand, you don't understand
Yo, we tryin' to get your attention now London
You can't handle the truth
You can hate me now (Don't hate us)
You don't faze me now
I'm so drunk I'm throwin' up now (Throwin' up now)
You can't hate me now (You can't hate us now)
You can't deflect me now
Yo, Slim, rock that funky shit!

Hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white person
Trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill, human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
'Cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back-strikin' a Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No duh I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?
You can hate me now

Yeah, hate us (Big Proof, Big Proof, Big Proof)
Ha, ha, ha!
Need to run for cover
Eminem is white, but he still my brother
Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack
But you and Charli Baltimore got something in common, you both whack
How you feel about that? No need to jock 'em
You so whack you make Master P sound like Rakim
When it's time to bust y'all, when we trust y'all, we dust y'all
Who y'all? Break your balls like cue balls
I know who you are, you RuPaul
Do stall, for those try to fall and try to brawl
All y'all get bust up and banged up, framed up
How many MC's bring my name up?
The same slut said the same thing, it's freestyle
No need to rehearse, my verse is universal
Curse a flow, crush you like Hershel Walker
Allie Sparker, three day sparker highland Parker chalker
You MCs can't get darker than the Midwest bracket
It's us, me and Emzee
Come right there, we feeling flimsy
Tipsed up, one time lifetime we ripped up
It's bad to the evil, met that, now it's all to say
Death rap, fuck hoes, don't even say get blast away, passed away
Blasted ass, hey yo, they say we're Aftermath
Slim Shady, you heard that, my words black
But bust you up 'cause you preferred that
To hear me now, preferred that, the surgical snipe
Preserved you with life, I'll make you allergic to life
You die for this, don't even battle us
See us at the―what's that?―Subterranean
We knock your brain in

Flows are hmm delly-lah like Arabian! (*Proof mimicking Arabian speech*)
Ayo, ayo
We don't wanna hear that best white rapper
We be talkin' 'bout best rapper
Forget all that, you know what I'm sayin' ?
No doubt, no doubt, never
Blastin' off
Explosions left and right (Left and right)
This is legendary (It's legendary)
Legendary! (Remember this show!)
This is John Lennon, this is John Lennon, legendary (Remember this show)
History, baby
We on some John Lennon
Blowin', blowin'
We blowin' the spot right now, London
Where it's war yo!
Blowin'!
It doesn't even matter
Slim Shady, Big Proof
C'mon Tim Westwood
We blowin' up the spot right now, London!
London's done, it's gone!
What did ya think baby? You made that happen
Thanks for having us, Tim
No doubt, no doubt, we blowin' up the spot
We blastin' off with Tim Westwood now
You understand what's going on, London? No doubt!
Big up New York, big up Paris, big up London
Big up Jersey, big up Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan
Big up Tim Westwood
Yo, we makin' it happen, yo!
On your wheel, just still
Tim Westwood, where it's born!
Peace to everybody, have a good night's sleep
