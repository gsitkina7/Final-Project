CDs ain't selling no more anyways, man
Look at SoundScan
I really don't think it matters if—

Everything I do is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut at number two
So why do you? If we make money, then why can't you
Be satisfied with what you do?
It's like our legacy's pregnant, we're plantin' eggs every record
They're beggin' me to release a CD every other second
But don't expect it, 'cause every time I get hit with that question
I just deflect it, get Ca$his or 50's record and check it
And Buck is out, like get these motherfuckers out 'fore I smack 'em
Plus T.I. just dropped an album now, go out and get that one
And I got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable
Of holdin' a label 'til I figure out when I'm ready to drop
Or maybe not, Shady, look how hot you were, on top
You were pop, you were so popular, now you're not
You're a washed up entrepreneur, how's it possible? Well, it's not
If your little fickle minds would've caught on, but you didn't
See, I don't rap for the green, I mean, I ain't greedy
But I also know what it's like to be needy
And I will never go back to poverty, see, it ain't easy
To try to step away from entertainment, separate it from CDs
And every day it just seems like we're beefin'
Even the media's meat eaters, they gotta give you something
To read or you won't buy it, believe what you wanna believe
Let 'em feed to you the BS, P.S., peace to T.I., you 'gon be 'aight
And we out...

Peace
Hold 'ya head up, partner
You know how we gonna do what we're gonna do
We gon' touchdown, back up in the private charter planes
We gon' touchdown, you know we gon' get it crackin' man
We gon' touchdown, I told you ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby, they gon' make a bigger riot
When we touch—
