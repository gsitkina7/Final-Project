Huh, huh, huh, huh
(Oh yeah) Oh yeah
The Pooh Butt Day
One of those (Oh yeah) sticky type of things to  upon
Check it out (Oh yeah)

Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as all hell
Went to use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell
All the way downstairs and onto the couch
And I pissed my pants on the way down South
So I went back upstairs to change my underwear
Took a while to get 'em unstuck from my pubic hair
Finally got unzipped I went to put 'em down the street
But then I threw 'em in the garbage cause it all said "Pew"
Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair
Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there
That damn toilet it must'a went foul
Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel
Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash
So I sat and played Super Mario on my Nintendo
I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff
Man today I just feel like a pooh butt
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today

Now every single day I make habits to get up
But today I just feel like a pooh butt
So I'll stay in bed I don't know whats wrong with me
I'm just taking everything nonchalantly
I just feel like I can't move one muscle
My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle
My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8
It's 7:15 looks like I'm gonna be late
Aw, forget that baby said I just can't make it
I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it
I'm sick in bed I'm making 
But before I hung up the phone she told me where I could put it
Comes next day I got a call from M&M he said
"We gotta make a record, get ya butt outta bed"
I said "I ain't doin' nothing, I wish you nothing but luck," he said "What's up?" I said I feel like a pooh butt

Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Yo, you ever have one of those pooie, stinky
Ridiculous, rotten days, M&M?
Man I had one once, check this out

Woke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning
Gotta get to the recording studio
I gotta get a take done
Put all my rhymes together so I can make one
Get outta bed, fall on my head
Slipped on the rug, I thought I was dead
Cussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing
Only a concussion, shake it off, get off the ground
Look around, couldn't find my rhyme sheets
Where'd I put 'em down?
They were just there last night on the chair
Had to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere
Go to the basement might of misplaced 'em
Gotta find 'em in hurry but my visions still blurry
Goin' down the stairs, what could happen next?
But, when its this early you can't skip steps
Fallin' head first, as I fall, I curse
Things are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse
Achin', I shake and I hurt, I stand up slowly
Wiped all the dirt off, memory lapse
I can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse
If you forget the whole thing pause for a second
What was I looking for?
Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets; they might be on the floor
Or on the chair
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
Damn, how does time fly?
Think for a second, recall my memory
If I was a rhyme sheet, where would I be?
Now I remember, I put em in the closet next to my jacket
So I would'a never lost em
Already 7:00? I've only got an hour to eat breakfast
Get dressed, plus take a shower got undressed
Got the zest off the rack
Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack
Cold as hell, started to yell, jumped out the shower
And said fuck it, I'll smell
Grabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed
Still had to eat, plus my hair was a mess
I was in a rush, grabbed the brush
And ran, right into the door, on the floor I land
Always to fate now; I know I'm cursed
I think it might help if I open the door first
Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist
But that's what happens on a day like this
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today

Wow, that sounds pretty pooie to me
Now, I'm gonna break it down for all the people who don't know what a pooh butt day is

Now, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had
No particular depression, neither mad or sad
You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is
Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt
Then you're feeling like shit
They come up at a certain time, they don't have a season
But most of the time you feel like one for no particular reason
They get a careless attitude, the yucky sensations
Some people won't accept love in a pooie situation
Sittin' on the toilet for an hour or so
Marks on the butt from the seat on the bowl
Grab a toilet paper and the seat and just wipe
When I realize I may have sat the in the seat too tight
So I struggle to  from a stuck position
But removing myself was an impossible mission
Screaming to get out, I couldn't take it any more
When my mother arrived and knocked upon the door
We pulled and pulled and I was removed from the seat
I couldn't sit down for a whole damn week
Never again will I get caught in that rut
So I can stay fresh instead of feeling like a pooh butt

Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today

Well the very next day, 
Felt the pooh butt sick but am I defeated I survived
So I went downstairs and managed not to fall
Since I was feeling better I get Manix to call
Well,  said "Oh," says
"Ey s-wzup whut up, you gotta go?"
"I'm feeling pretty good, what about if I come over?
We can practice for a while, order the pizza, are you sober?"
He said: "I ain't gonna go, nope, I'm not going
You wanna know the reason why I'm sound like ?
Because I got pneumonia, I'm  something to do, but uhm
If you could smell the way I'm saying, you'd be saying 'pew!'"
I thought for a second and I said, "I don't get it"
Manix said, "just forget it home's
I ain't going out in this weather
I don't feel like doin' nothing but I leavin' you too it
Don't be comin' over feelin' 'cause i'm feeling like pooh!"
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh

Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today

Pooh butt! I feel like a pooh butt!
Sometimes I feel like a pooh butt!
When you just can't get up
When you feel like you want to stay in bed all day
That's an example of a pooh but day
Ooooooh, pooh butt, oh!
My example of a pooh butt day
Is when you have a foot falls asleep, for the whole day
But you've got a track run at one o'clock!
You know what pisses me off, is when we get all the parts down except James gets a lag on his throat and he fucks up, and you know what else pisses me off is, whatever's pissing me off in that particular moment, that's what's usually pissing me off
I'm gonna end this song by saying, uh
Pooh buuutt!
