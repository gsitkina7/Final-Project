Not nice, or the meanest
Feelin' sorry for my mama'nem
Survivor's guilt really get old
Whole gang in the end zone
Not nice, or the meanest
Heaven's Gate when I get home
Color palettes lookin' Pantone
'Bout to turn into a phantom
Cameras off, get to flippin' lights
She ain't happy with the other guy
Had a argument the other night
I ain't even get to 'pologize
While I'm in the meetings lookin' disguised
I'ma show face 'til I get tired
Don't carе about event size
Lookin' at you through a fishеye
I'm never nice, or the meanest
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, yeah
We here, you can't deny that we here, we here (Woo)
Hands up, me throwin' for my fan (Migo)
For Abloh, Rest In Peace to my man (Uh, hey)
I seen the feet prints in the sand (Uh, woo)
We done everything that we planned

Huncho, I **** it big, you did it, kid, you did it, kid (We did it)
Like a **** just got potty trained
Hourglass, how her body came (Yeah)
Chop 'em down, with the what-it-name (Grrah)
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm tellin ‘ya
Pushin' P, Bill Bellamy (P)
**** ridin' with a felony
See the jealousy
The struggle made me a better me (Struggle)
Why you talkin', is you payin' me?
Lamborghini coated candy (Skrrt)
If I **** her, she gon' have the baby
I'm the plan A, and the plan B (Hey)
Quarter million to the nannies (Go)
I'm the head of the family (Hey)
My momma had to cry for this
My gang had to slide for this (Slide)
Pistol Pete had to die for this (Die)
Doin' time through the wire for this (Hey)
Fresh out the bricks to a brick (Brick)
We steppin' outside with the **** (Outside)
Hannah Montana with grits (Hannah)
That honey bun gon' make 'em blitz (Grah)
I'm up, I'm rich, look at my ****, she fine and rich (Look)
Studied the game and I find the glitch
Hustla', I got a mind like Mitch (Hey)
He not poppin', he kinda lit
He not wealthy, he kinda rich (Kinda)
**** ain't trippin', just signed this ****
Hunnid mill', we'll split (Split it)
If it's fifty mill', we'll split
If it's two in one, they'll split (Split)
Three **** split a G6
These platinum plaques ain't nothin'
I stand over 'em take a ****
I stand over and take a **** (Hey)
This a hunnid thousand on the wrist (Hunnid)
Get the money, never politic
Floor seats, Atlanta versus the Knicks
Young **** with the birds, Kyle Pitts (Brr)
In the 'adium, 'Cedes Benz (Yeah)
Kid gon' play with 'em, he got friends
He know Migo dem, knock off limbs
Yeah, we did it, kid, to the M’s
Ridin' Presidential with the rims (Skrrt)
Helpin' Ye find Kim in the black double M Benz (Maybach)
No new friends, Nobu with my twins (Nobu)
Remember we kicked that door down because they didn't let us in (Woo)
Born to win, I committed a sin with a see-through lens (See-through)
I filled up all my pockets, now you get a pocket to pick
Thank God I'm alive and rich (Alive)
No lie, I survived the trench
Pay my tithe, livin' marvelous (Tithes)
That's the reason I don't talk of this (Hey)
Hand-built it like a carpenter did it
Shootin' bullets out the cars for this (Grrah)
Tattoos and the scars for this (Tats)
'Member when we used to borrow fits (Hey)
Lyrics from Snippet 1

Never get lit again (Never get lit again)
It hit me, it give me adrenaline (It do)
The demons are making me sin again (They are)
They trying to change how I am livin' it (Nah)
Got too much money to get rid of him (Woo)
We did it kid, we did it, huh (We did it)
I like my bitches submissive
Lyrics from Snippet 2

...adrenaline, one in the 
 shoulda been, but this one is different
All-all-all-all the shit niggas done said about me
I'll be dead about me, I'll be scared about me
Would not all with...
