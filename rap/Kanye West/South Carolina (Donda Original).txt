Please welcome Dr. Donda West
Forever, ever
Can you hear me? Yeah
Forever, ever
Forever, forever, no
Glorious, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory, glory

It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What do you want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I described in the introduction is being so decidedly different
My son (When you're runnin' outta time and you're not outta time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (Change the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)

Forever, yeah
Forever, yeah
Forever, forever, no, oh, yeah
Glorious, glory, glory, glory
What did I teach him? (Glory)
And why Kanye ain't scared?

I'd rather deal with the shame than take the weight of the lie
Every time we talk I just wait for the lies
Every time I get the food, I just wait for the flies
Look, just send your prayers up, they'll be waitin' in the skies
My, my, my, Miss American Pie
Was a hero after Katrina but that levee went dry
Mom met my dad back in '75
Two years later, the chosen has arrived
Holy, Holy, Holy Father
Hold me in an ocean worth of Holy Water
And David's slingshot, hope it throws you farther
You brought church to stadiums built for only soccer
When the world built on lies, the truth is a threat
Faith over the fortune, it kept you outta debt
It's snakes in money pits that you ain't found yet
Crooks behind the scene like, "He ain't drown yet?"
Rain bills from the ranch 'til the whole town wet
God's grace rains down, that's the holy fountain
Got twelve thousand acres full of holy mountains
See, you almost didn't make it, who are you without Him?
Holy, Holy, Holy Father, hold me in a ocean the size of Holy Water
Man, if plan A worked, you wouldn't know your daughter
For every tear you cried in South Carolina
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
