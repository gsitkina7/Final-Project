Glory, the old things will pass away
Holy, prophecy, the spirit and the bride say
Jesus reigns, glory, get down on your knees and pray
Have faith, yeah, believe what the Bible say
Jesus reigns, give us grace to fight with power
Beyond human strength
Supernatural gifts, you shower on your faithful saints

We got something better than gold
Blessings raining down a thousandfold
Grace and anointing overflow
Goodness and mercy follow
Glory dripping all over the place
Tables spread like a buffet
We ain't worried 'bout what people say
We gon' worship God anyway
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)

Glory, the old things will pass away
Holy, prophecy, the spirit and the bride say
Jesus reigns, glory, get down on your knees and pray
Have faith, yeah, believe what the Bible say
Jesus reigns, give us grace to fight with power
Beyond human strength
Supernatural gifts, you shower on your faithful saints

We can feel it burning in our souls
Jesus take the wheel, that's cruise control
We just called the Holy Ghost
The doors to the church are never closed
Satan get behind me Fury Road
Jesus take the wheel, that's cruise control
Devil throwing up the  like 
Like the doors in the church are never closed

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Do-do-do-do)
