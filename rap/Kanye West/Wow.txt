Introducing
Mister I-Ain't-Know-You-Did-That
And Mister Oh-That's-My-Favorite-Shit
And Mister Ah-Damn-I-Wish-That-Was-a-Single
And uh, like Noreaga say, it goes... ugh!

I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou'
You go with twenty-five hundred (Wow)
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single—damn, nigga! (Wow)
"H to the Izzo" did three thou' spins in a week
You did a thou' in a month (Wow)
Y'all niggas want credit, but y'all need to slow down
Kanye To The, killin' y'all from Chi-Town
How your wife gon' say she never sold drugs a day in her life?
But she still wanna pump the 'Ye?
And y'all mad 'cause y'all not knowin
'Cause these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up, whether to stop or keep going
I got Gs, rock rock 'n' roll tees with no sleeves
Tats showin', tucked in, strap showin'
How he get seven TVs in that ‘lac-‘lac?
Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back-back
While you in that hatchback
And try to sell work and don’t get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studios won't give you ya DATs back
And try to get publishin', all you get in your ass capped (That's all, nigga)
And that’s that

I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou'
You go with twenty-five hundred (Wow)

Magazines call me a rock star, bitches call me cock-star
Billboard pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-Town go-getting pimps, we mobsters
Gingerbread man even says, “You’re a monster”
Remember that? Uh-huh, that’s that Shrek shit
Remember back in ’92, niggas used to "catch wreck," shit
Remember that track I tracked for you 'bout three months ago?
Uh-huh, that’s the one—now cut my check, bitch
And I ain't feeling that Lexus
More that CLK; see me like, "Damn, a CL, K?”
Yeah, that’s how we eating and, keep us looking peace and then
"I ain't know he rap as good as he do beats," and then

Now, niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
You know the rules, five up close, one gon' leave ya
You don't know about Kanye? Son gon' teach you
What's the first thing that popped in your mind
While I was popping this rhyme?
You don't picture popping a nine?
See, you paralyzed from the top of the spine...
