I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
You know what I'm saying
I'm saying I put my personality into it

These hoes is all the same
They all want a nigga hollering out "money ain't a thang"
'Bout pathetic as a player that lost his game
How a motherfuckin' hoe turn a pimp to a lame
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Cause that's how these hoes'll get you wrapped up
Calling you later saying what she crying about
Put that bitch on now what she lying about
Talking about how she late and how she eat a lot
See she eat a lot cause she smoke weed a lot
Why all the bogus hoes want to front on k
Why the fine hoes can't have one on the way
I prolly tell her to keep it, it'll be our little secret
Boniquan now my shorty looking fine: Puerto Rican
As long as she don't flip it tell her man that we creepin'
What we doin' is all day
When I hang up it ain't called hate its called wait
When you get popped don't call me call Clayton
That's your man ain't it
That's the plan ain't it
When she told me it was mine I damn near fainted
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though (He told me it is so done)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe (So that you know now)
I got your baby on the way

Now these hoes run gun I ain't finna say nothing
She tried to pop my pockets before I even got paid
Don't trip, this bitch was a whip
You could learn something from her but you might get burned from her
We smoked a couple of dimes I hit it a couple of times
Now she say she pregnant and its mine
I'm thinking she was lying by the looks on her face
But she started paging me like every single day
She said her man going away the judge gave him three
Must've thought she was gon' make a fool out of me
To bail this nigga out all she need was a G
Now she must've came to me so I had to change the beat
I said look hoe you must be crazy off that dope
That's when I snatched the rope then I kicked her on the floor
And all that shit I bought you bitch I want it back
You lied to me return of the Mac
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though (He told me it is so done)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe (So that you know now)
I got your baby on the way

All y'all niggas is new with it
I paid my dues with it
Gave hoes abortion loot they bought shoes with it
Say they pregnant who's is it
Tell 'em you did it
Forcing these niggas out of abortion cheese
Paid a couple of hundred now or later more than G's
 have a kid by a lame ass broad
I knocked up this girl I barely liked cause she bugged me
She ain't even cute, our baby prolly by ugly
And I ain't happen to have that baby and your stomach doing having that
How much it cost to get rid of it? I give you half of that
But I didn't know that she was on the pill
Needed the money for her hair and her nails
And her cell phone bill
Hoes'll get you its like getting robbed without a pistol
What up on a nigga
Come up on a nigga
Then you wait a month like you not the one cause she ain't got no proof
What happen nine months later when she was telling the truth
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though (He told me it is so done)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe (So that you know now)
I got your baby on the way
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
