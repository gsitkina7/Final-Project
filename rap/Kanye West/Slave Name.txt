Just love on me 'cause that's just what I need
Your love on me is all I ever need, need

Part of my blessings blending in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been drive a little million miles on this roads
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
They be sellin' something when it's not shame
West stole West, simply got shame
Givin' up, I'm givin' up my slave name
Oh, no, no, I'm givin' up my slave name
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
Bump on the song for the dark chains
I'm givin' up the slave name
It's a choice for me
Y'all can't cut out the voice in me
Y'all can't do nothing, get mad at me
Y'all came for my anatomy
Y'all can't cut out the Harriet
I don't care how you carry it
Stomp, stomp, that'd be very lit
God stomp, wanna be alien
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
And Chicago, yo, they lost, but we not bought
Oh, then he tells 'em

Part of my blessings blending in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been drive a little million miles on this roads
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
It's like they take our slave women
And bend them quicker than when we hit it
Where you think lightskin came from? (Huh?)
I heard the Chinese buyin' Africa quicker than we would get it
And if you tell somebody you goin' to Africa
Somebody would laugh at ya
Like the top off it, and spend it at the Gucci store
Hold on more, woah, woah
Don't tell me 'bout them woke facts (Woke fact)
Them just sound like broke facts (Broke facts)
I don't know who the fuck told you that (Told you that)
I don't know who the fuck sold you back (Told you that)
Buy your freedom 'fore they sell you back (Sell you back)
Why we need 'em? They just sold you crack (Sold you crack)
So let's done 'em, where the soldiers at? (Soldiers at)
Most of them ain't running, most of them want that bump (Ooh)
Face the gun in the sun, we been brainwashed (Ooh)
Fuck that, we in our own holocaust (Ooh)
It ain't never ended, it all depends (Ooh)
The Jews, least they said, never again

Part of my blessings blending in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been drive a little million miles on this roads
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
And Chicago, yo, and Chicago
