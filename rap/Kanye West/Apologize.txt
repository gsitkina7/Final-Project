Ah-ahem
There's something I did
There's something I can explain how to-
I can't speak for everybody but, um, man

It must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys (Haha)
And mess with other girls part-time to improvise (Haha)
I knew she wasnâ€™t bi, no, I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me 'bout how black people should enterprise (Haha)
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise (Haha)
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by five
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, dawg, fuck it, I didn't lie (Haha)
Told her this rap game is alright, I'm just getting by (Haha)
She had a little weed and we get a little high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in '95, she fell in love with the Tribe (Haha)
Boo, back in '92, I was just like you (Haha)
Please, don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school (Haha)
And think, "Yeah, Free's banging but she's no Rachel" (Haha)
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall. after we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies (Haha) and I would like to apologize (Haha)
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall, after we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies (Haha) and I would like to apologize (Haha)
But you can't stand right here and tell me everything is going to be alright (Haha)
'Cause until that a real (Haha) man stands up, I'm going to have to improvise (Haha)

Was it something I did wrong? (Haha) Yeah, I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive (Haha)
Now she on the internet, looking for classes (Haha)
Out of state though, man, that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do, she pouring out her heart (Haha)
"You never listen to me," then the call drop, hmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal, I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal, I was back in the ring (Haha)
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges (Haha)
Never had money, so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryna see, can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari (Haha) and a dinner date with Halle Berry? (Haha)
Went from fifty G's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call
One ring, two rings, seven rings, eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone (Haha)
Like, "She in school and she don't stay here no more" (Haha)
I guess there's more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys (Haha)
And focus on school full-time to improvise (Haha)
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall. after we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies (Haha) and I would like to apologize (Haha)
