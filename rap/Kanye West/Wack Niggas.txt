Shh (Chill out)
Yeah, yeah, uh-uh-uh-uh
Wack niggas (Huh, huh)
Wack niggas (Yeah)
Wack niggas (Yeah, come on) (Turn it up)
Wack niggas (Yeah, turn it up)
Yo, yo, yo-yo (Turn up the volume)
Yo, yo, yo, yo-yo, yo
Double man, Kanye, you know we from the Chi
Kweli and K-MC, we in the bricks right now recordin'
Let's do it, come on (Yo)
I wish all wack niggas'd get out the game (Come on)
You can't con me, that’s half my name (That's right)
And if you had any brains you wouldn't wanna lose half your brain
By hating on players in the game
Wack nigga, the beat go, “Duh-duh-da”
And then your flow go way the fuck off
I kill y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips (Woo)
But I'm not trying to cause commotion
And have my niggas bring all the toast in (Ah)
I just want your girl to rub my balls with lotion
'Cause you got madder, ripped down all my posters
But you came at me like, "Yo, I got the Kia with the woodgrain"
Haha, yeah, you would, lame (Wack niggas)
"On the real, in the streets, I got the good name, I got the TV"
Yeah, that’s good, mane

It's time to change up, my lyrics rip your frame up
Asking if I'm nice, like fucking with a chick that don't give head
That's a no-brainer
Niggas pack bangers y'all don't even know the names of
I’m about to meet the quota, you about to meet the savior
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got
Word, not that I'm wilding or even promoting violence
It's just you fucking up my high, can't a nigga smoke in silence?
You wack niggas
Wake up in the morning, dawg, you just some wack niggas
I'd kill myself if I was that wack niggas
Everything you wear and rock is just wack niggas
Even if you flossing rocks, you just wack niggas
You can't do it, dawg, you's a wack niggas (Uh, come on)
Biting ass, bitch ass, trick ass wack niggas
Even your daughter says, "My Daddy's a–" wack niggas
You wack nigga

(In the beginning) Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever (Uh)
Black Benz, white truck and one two-seater
Wack niggas hold hands and follow the procedure (Haha)
'Cause I got enough tools that one gon' leave you
If I drop enough dudes, man, one gon' reach you
If they build enough schools, man, one gon' teach you
Kanye the shit, but I ain't trying to be feces-tious (Ooh)
