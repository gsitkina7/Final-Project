Spit it to you, say ''Little West to little beast''
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace

Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama Benz, Jeep
With put fifty, I get this on the first tape
But that fifty that break the bank (Uh-huh)
Back when my ATM was crazy slim, had a girl nicknamed Sprewell
'Cause when I try to stop she still made me spin (Uh)
Back when Aviâ€™s was in, my dog Crazy Ken had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dancefloor, get crazy again (Uh)
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted (Uh), so tinted she squinted (Okay)
She said, "This car real old," I told her her it was vintage (Haha)
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
I'ma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside
Now I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"

Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace
Please, what I gotta win five Grammys
Before you finally let me play Alicia's keys?
If I can't bone, I'll get a clone
Get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She bobbin', don't stop her there
Told me that she love the Roc so much
She drove all the way to Far Rockaway for a Rocawear
More popular, 'cause I abracadabra my Nissan (You was rigged?)
To a car throwing a peace sign, peace
Damn, that's like the same line I used in the first verse
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait, it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K 'fore we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew see K
In a CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
I'm tryna find a crazy female with a cutie face
I big pimp her on the DL like UGK
And then I told her
Now, I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"
