I feel terrific, I feel, good
I feel the losin’, I feel, uh
Fools ain't laugh my way, I got my shares up for a while
I got two like Shane, I got my views up for a while
I don't think I can fools, stop when lights out for a while
Take my hand, my own, these headphones could cost up for the line

Little light of mine, shine for photo shine
Hold like  my, woah, all in his new time
Make sure North for prime, next up for the prime
Text up on my ride, text up, photo shine
I feel terrific, I've got the move
I've got the brand new spirit
All of y'all deaf when I cannot lose
I want the paparazzi to flick, no matter what he do
Nigga, I can do what I want
Y’all just want me and you
I’m gon’ tell ya, I feel terrific
I'm special, I fail to lose
I got turned up with my Beretta
I'm turned up and I can't lose
I paid murder, y’all up for nothing
I don't care about the news
It's the blood of Jesus Christ
I done lost it for you
He gon' make it
I feel terrific, I can't lose
I feel special, mm, mixed up with lose
