I married the best rapper of all time
Not only that, he's the richest Black man in America
A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids

Let me not, let me not
I better not, it'd be best if I stop (Woo)
Let me not, go apeshit, full BAPE
I was down, no e— (Yeah, ayy)
I was down, no escape
I was down, ain't no escape
There's no escape
Lupe out my town, had to skate (Skate, kick, push)
We just said goodbyе, but it's straight (But it's straight, ayy)
I fuck with her vibe, it's okay (It's okay, ayy)
Got me hypnotizеd, in a daze
Protect my mind
Protectin' what's mine

Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi? (Wi-Fi)
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi? (Wi-Fi)

Do your thing now
Then and now, passin' out
When you lay down and I gave you the semen
I swear I heard God, the voice of Morgan Freeman (Freeman)
Baby, bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye
Baby, bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye
I'm just going to remove myself
From the situation 'fore I lose myself
From the situation 'fore I lose my health
I can't control you but I could lose myself

Welcome to the Sci-Fi

Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi?
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice already, oxygen or Wi-Fi?!
