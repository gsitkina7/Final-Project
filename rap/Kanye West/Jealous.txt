Ohh, don’t act like you care about me (Care about me)
Ohh, don't act like you care about me (Care about me)
Don't act like you care about me, don’t act like you care about me
Saved by the bell

Fuck it, you only live once (Woo)
Done with all the stuntin' down the pipeline (You)
'Cept for a nigga like me (Ugh)
I done lived at least eight lifetimes (You)
Bitch, you got too much jokes (You lose)
Aha, everything you say funny

This bitch laughin’ at this nigga joke
Ah, yeah, I’ma see this bitch (Woo)
Let me fuck you from the back, though
Let me fuck you while I'm mad, though (Agh)
On God, fuck a stripper bitch like Amber Rose

Ridin' with this nigga, all on, all on-on that nigga dick
Oh shit, God damn work
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore we get home, bitch, ahh (Win)
You gon' believe this bitch now? (You win)

Oh, Ye, oh, Ye, what you talkin’ 'bout?
In the front verse, oh, you should walk it out
I don't even give a fuck if you talkin' 'bout
What the fuck you want that fame, what you talkin' 'bout me?
I'm singin' this lowkey, you sittin' here before me
Everytime that you phone me
And I'm feelin' like a worst guy, had me feelin' like it's rest time
Listen, baby, for me, listen, baby, for me
I just want that bag if you add it, I just want to know if you ridin'

And I want a 20 on my chain, it dangles
Bands on me, I just might fuck your bitch like Bang Bros
So much jewelry on my neck, my fuckin' bank froze
And I wanna fuck it while I'm watchin' bank roll
Cut the roof off, you can't breathe when I smash it
Diamonds on funk and I bleed when I'm ashin'
Cut the roof off, you can't breathe when I smash it
Diamonds on funk and I bleed when I'm ashin'
Ride on my wrist, I got your ride on my wrist
Rollie on them bands when I ride on my wrist
Five on the fist, cop five on the fist
Then I want a forty, got five on my wrist
And I know you're no snake, been fuckin' on my bae
I'm fuckin' up a check and I wonder why
Been down on-on the tracks and I'm flippin' on a bitch
I'm fuckin' up a check and I wonder why
And I musta be a bun digger chanter
And I musta cutta fund that I shot up
And I go, and I go, and I said I go
Hannibal, diamonds up, ain't no matter, though
Racks in the bank, it's up, I'm on the payroll
I'm the one, I choose to paper chase, baby
Racks in the bank, it's up, I'm on the payroll
I'm the one, I choose the paper
Ohh, don't act like you care about me
Ohh, don't act like you care about me (Care about me)
Ohh
