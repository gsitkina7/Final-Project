Can't wait to see your new body
Let the Lord of love be your new body
You've been born again in your new body
So it's on to get in your new body, woah

New walk, new talk, who that, who this?
Who else you know this bad, a few kids
Nobody nowhere, ever gave you this
Nobody flew to Colombia, like you did
Trying the new dress out with the new drip
Buying a new bag, first one to get
Nothing that you miss, is on your to-do list
And now you're intune with, divine influence
Old sins don't count, old fans might bounce
Told the devil, "Get behind me, I ain't ever gon' renounce"
Non-believers try to doubt, but we never go without
Mind, body, soul, who you think you dealing wit' now?
This a new chick, got a party table at the Ruth Chris
All God's children take a group pic
Turn the flash off 'cause we too lit
You used to twerk to every-every song
Get carded everywhere, look very, very young
New spirit new body, like Christ on the throne
All glory be to God, Hallelujah, carry on
Can't wait to see your new body
Let the Lord of love be your new body
You've been born again in your new body
So it's on to get in your new body, woah

New body, rebirthing hard
Lord, I'd give my life to you, you deserve it all
Now when duty calls, I ain't perfect
I know sometimes I get weak, but it's worth it
You the one I big up, never give up
Only thing I'm tryna do is give them sins up
Look up at the scoreboard, I know that you won
It doesn't matter how they coming if they too young
'Cause every last one gon' be returning
And that's the message that we take from every sermon
That's why I'm turning to Your commandments
'Cause in the end I know You'll never leave me stranded (Ooh, yeah)

Can't wait to see your new body (Your new body, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Let the Lord of love be your new body (Let the lord)
You'll be born again in your new body (Born again, born again)
So it's on to get in your new body, woah
