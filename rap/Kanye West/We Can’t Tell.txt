Everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Every—Everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?

Niggas repping the 'Go, but we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, nigga, we can't tell
You claim you got dough, but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale
Politics kept me at the end of the mixtape
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got BIG
'Cause I moved up out the city and got big
That's the poison that run through their veins
And attacks they soul and just start to tear 'em up
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut ("Where you going?")
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing (I ain't playing with y'all niggas)
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats hisself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own (Uh-huh)
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help

Y'all bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas gettin' dough, dog, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s on a two-for-one sale
I cop Ides by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'ma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'ma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twista, the Flic', and Do or Die (What up)
So first of all, who am I? ("The fuck is you?")
My—My—My name is Kanye and not Kayne, bitch
At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with
No, none of that same shit, that new and improved
Now, I don't know if it's me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
But I'm so live/smooth, there's nothing to prove (Ooh-OOH!)

You niggas 'bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas gettin' dough, dog, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

Ayo, everywhere I go I'm a star, star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Now, everywhere I go I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
