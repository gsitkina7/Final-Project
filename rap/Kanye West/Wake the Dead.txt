Final, time's off
Time's up, time off
Had it been, final
Turnin' up, tie in all
Heaven all wrecked, ooh
Done had it with this reign, mhm
It was written, so I read
Three stacks on the bed
I think they woke the dead
Think they woke the dead, mhm
They can't keep me on the meds, doctor won't
But they, won't slow down my bread, uh
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead

I think they woke the dead

Think they woke the dead, doctor won't
They can't keep me on the meds, doctor won't
But they, won't slow down my bread, uh
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead

Just like David said
Grindin' for the bread
Designin' for the blessed, uh
There's so many less, I think they woke the dead
Doctor won't, ah, ooh-yeah, doctor won't (Ooh-yeah)
Doctor won't, three stacks on the bed, doctor won't
I think they woke the dead

Think they woke the dead, mhm
They can't keep me on the meds, doctor won't
But they, won't slow down my bread, uh
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead
Final, time's off
Time's up, time off
Had it been, final
There's so many less, I think they woke the dead
Time stopped, my loss
All they wish, my loss
Every stop, that's your loss
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead
Final, time's off
Time's up, time off
Had it been, final
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead
