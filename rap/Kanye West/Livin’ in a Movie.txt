Yo, this sound like some movie shit, right?
Get your popcorn, get your condiments
You don't want to miss nothing, okay, listen, uh

They call me Edward Scissorhands 'cause I'm trying to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gon' get you to suck
And you not gon' use your teeth, you hear?
You gon' find out what lies beneath right here
The preacher's wife don't give head, get a divorce, man
The kids been calling you the headless horseman
Like sleepy hollow, see she swallow
Suck like old girl got booed at Apollo 13, ghosts
Use my hollow, man, for friday thirteenth
You be ghost from the toast
Niggas who drop names is, oh, so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, they almost famous
My bling got 'em calling me Lord of the Rings
Shining make it hard for her to do the right thing
But I don't say a word, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell
And I'm living a movie, not living by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
One, two, Ye coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door (Uh-uh)
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never sleep again (Uh)

Shit's deeper than the sleepers
The Jeeper creep up on your block and cops clock us
Try to Baller Block us, use absolute power
You gave him nine and a half weeks, why you trying to rush ours, huh?
And in the cell don't drop soap in the showers, huh
They try to give me life, I'm out in an hour, huh
Back on the block with more juice than Pac
Making more money 'cause of The-the-the-the Roc

And I'm living a movie, not living by rules
Yo, what you talking about, man?
You know what I'm saying?
One, two, Ye coming for you (See this more like I did it)
Three, four, better lock your door (This only part one, part two?)
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never sleep again (Woo, I said some shit, like, umm, I'm tryna remember shit)

I said some shit like, umm
If you in my things, you suicide kings
There's only three kings, me, myself, and Irene
You know what I'm saying?
It's a lot, yo
