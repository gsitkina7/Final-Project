It's real, all dreams real
My boy text me, he told me, "Dream big"

Like the cars that we own now, 'member we used to lease it
Now we undefeated, look at what the team did

All dreams are real
All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real
All dreams, real, real
Spirit of Coltrane with us
Old slang, you know the old sayin'
Ho's saying, "He sold out," out the stores, mane
I like soul beats and pj's, I'm so plain
Opps crowded around my house like I was Houssein
Came and grabbed me out my house like I was insane
Doc sayin', "There's somethin' wrong with his membrane"
I've been sufferin' from lack of sleep, bitch, I been drained
Gotta high type of tolerance for that type of pain
Pour some, I wan' go numb 'till it's okay
Here we go, I'm off the drink and now we in things
We was lowkey, heard you wanted to avenge things
We approached, we ain't gon' make it 'till the endgame
Guess that's just what he got to do to get the rent paid
I ain't gon' hate on no man to get a bill paid
Bills ain't the real pain, the real pain is real pain
Your self-hate, self-doubtin', fake love
But

All dreams, real (Real)
It's that no limitations, babe
All dreams, real (Real)

“Yeah, 'Ye cold
But that Trump hat forced me to feel like I like J. Cole.” Damn
My own city turned they back on me
They thought I told Push about Drake's son, goddamn
Like I ain't want them to run, goddamn
I guess they fall and they dumb, goddamn
I don't care about his son, goddamn
I just rap about me, goddamn
Niggas can't resist publicity for free, goddamn
Always wantin' somethin' like it isn't me, goddamn
Everytime, I rap it, this ain't charity, goddamn
Energy that never die, energy that stay alive
Energy, the synastry I'm finna see a synesthesia
I could see ya, color feel ya
Bona feature, extra features
I'm allegiant, all the deats, all the features
And the teachers and the preachers
They could reach us on the feature
All the leaches, all my features
I was just in the bleachers
Jump the bleachers, I'm a thesis
That's my thesis, Holy Jesus
Um
All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real (Real)

"Gotta let 'Ye be 'Ye"
Let me? Psh-psh-nigga?
