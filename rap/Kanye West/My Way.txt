I've lived
Yes, I've lived the life that's full (Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)
I've traveled each and every highway (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What more (Oh, oh, oh)
Yes, much more than this
I did it my way
Uh, uh

It go, "My way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway"
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The Roc got 'Ye, but they ain't snorting it
They just got him up at Baseline, recording shit
Yeah, I been broke, now I'm good, bitch
I ain't no Kennedy, but I'm hood-rich
So I say "My way" to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else: Thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I been beaten, but not broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said, "We free at last"
Ain't nothing free from that point, though, we needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians, just tryna eat at last
Now all the Blacks cooking up that almost white
'Cause getting green make 'em treat us like we almost white
Almost
I've lived
Yes, I've lived the life that's full (Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)
I've traveled each and every highway (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What more (Oh, oh, oh)
Yes, much more than this
I did it my way
Uh

It go, "My way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway"
Niggas wanna diss K on they local mixtapes
There they go again, lying to consumers
Get they hair cut in the Little Shop of Rumors
You lil' sloppy with your cockiness, ain't you?
A lil' arrogant with all your comparisons
'Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most plaques since the beginning of rap
But nah, y'all ain't mentioning that
Y'all just talk about my dough, how I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eating, shut your piehole
And want to figure out why I'm getting 'em high, though?
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say
Only difference between you and me, you a gay
"Aww, did he get his feelings hurt?"
"Nah, he got titties under his shirt"
I've lived
Yes, I've lived the life that's full (Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)
I've traveled each and every highway (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What more (Oh, oh, oh)
Yes, much more than this
I did it my way
Uh

It go, "My way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway"
When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, "Fuck that, dawg, I get my own way"
Niggas ain't believe me 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely getting head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway just like it's a relay
We stay four stars or better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
And we gon' flip Carter when we could afford better
And back before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial
Stay getting something off lay-away at Marshall's
Polo and Carbeshers, we into them things, dawg
Back in '96, we was living like kings, dawg
Forty-cals or better, toting them things, dawg
So up the Turkish mink and take them rings off
I've lived
Yes, I've lived the life that's full (Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)
I've traveled each and every highway (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What more (Oh, oh, oh)
Yes, much more than this
I did it my way
Uh
