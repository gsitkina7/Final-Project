Now you know you got to turn this super loud
Come on, now, let's go, uh

Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, uh, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, uh, uh, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Smokin' right here, yeah, uh, uh)
I know you're wondering, how is Kanye spitting so hot?
'Cause I listen to the Roc and I listen and watch
And the first thing I copped was a glistening watch
Off that Blueprint money, yeah, I know I'm a dummy
But what I'm supposed to tell a girl in the club
While that ass is getting feeled on?
What, I bought a couple build-ons?
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
'Cause on the real, son
If a girl think you broke, she just want to fuck and smoke
If you paid then she's thinking 'bout her children, feel him?
Probably not, though, 'less you got dough, you know what I mean
You would think the grass greener when you finally get green

Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay, uh

Man, I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years, ain't picked a career
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and
Now let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, take 'em, take 'em to the lake
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-uh, and say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now take 'em downtown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now take 'em back to the southside
Uh, uh

Man, I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Versace
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this!"
Plus, I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a Coupe
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take 'em to up, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now, take 'em up, what?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, turn the music hi-i-i-igher
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Now let me hear you say (And, uh, and, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I decided to quit fucking with you, umm)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Wack ass niggas and, umm)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Hating ass, dream killing ass niggas)

And since I quit
Everyone that supported me, thank you very much
And everyone that doubted me, thank you very little
