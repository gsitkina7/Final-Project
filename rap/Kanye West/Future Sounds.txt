Saw the future of the bounce
You can see wherever it soun-
I could do it where it counts
I got nothin' for the low
I been sonning for allowance
I been done up for the now
And that name I can't pronounce
I was always on the town
Tell me how you like it's sounds
Do you like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way it sounds?
That's the future of the bounce
Do you like the way it sounds? (Ha, ha)
Do you like the way it sounds? (Ha, ha)
Tell me now, do you like the way it sounds?

I can see the future is lookin' like we level through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory and eternal lastin' life
Won't you take the wheel? I'll recline and I'll sit still
Might as well turn up now, he gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?

I cannot take another ounce (Ah)
Runnin' for the crowd
I can't hear my thoughts, so loud
I can hear their doubts so loud
Do you like the way it sounds?
Feel like I've been gone for a while
But there ain't no turnin' back now
Miracles wash away the doubts
Then the drum line drops, do you like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
