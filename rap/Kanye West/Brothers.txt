We'll be brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be brothers forever
We'll be brothers forever
We'll be brothers forever
(Brothers forever)

We should've lit cigars, when your baby was born
Should've shouted you out and dedicated a song (Oh, oh)
I can say I was wrong, I can take the blame
'Cause brothers don't always have to share the same name
(Oh, oh)
We met when we was young, I forgot the grade
When last one to base was a rotten egg
Since then I done good and rotten things (Brothers forever)
So I could tell you one thing (Brothers forever)
As soon as I cut the grass low
It's easier to see the assholes
So I'm sorry for all the miscues
How about I admit that I miss you
I miss the fam and our brotherhood
I just wanna make sure that my brother's good
So I ain't embarrassed or above (Eh, eh)
Flying out to Paris for a hug
Or picking up the phone just to call up (Ooh)
Picking up the phone hope it's all love
'Cause Jesus taught us love, so did Moses and Mohammed (Ooh)
So nothing so atomic that we can't agree to drop it, chop it
Peace it up and get it poppin'
And bury the hatchet so we can lock in (Ohh-oh)
Why don't you still have him on the line?
We'll be (Woo) brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
(Brothers forever)

I wish I had a PA system for all the brothers we love
For the ones that was missing but joined the cut where we from
See how the DA did 'em, when they was hustling drugs
And that was in the city of brotherly love
See brothers are amused by other brother's reps
But it takes a real one to keep the other in check (Other in check)
So this fraternity's for eternity (Brothers forever)
And every rhyme I write is 25 to life (Brothers forever)
Every dime I wife thought I was Brian McKnight
And my homies said that you should shine your light
And the groupies gave us the time of our life
And I think about those times when I'm flying a flight
And I knew we'd reconnect when the timing was right
Man, I ain't spoke to you in like forever (Brothers forever)
Maybe it's time we put the band back together

We'll be brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
Brothers forever
Brothers forever (Uh, oh)
We'll be brothers forever (Oh)
Brothers forever, brothers forever (Ooh, ooh)
