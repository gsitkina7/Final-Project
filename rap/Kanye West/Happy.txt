(I be, I be, I be, I—)
Woo

Cook the dope, let me cook it, yeah
Junkies layin' outside the bushes, yeah
Do-si-dos syrup, yeah
You gold diggers, I deserve, yeah
A gang of **** bought purses, yeah
I did it off of one verse, yeah
I'm sippin' syrup inside the vert, yeah
I'm leavin' my mark on the Earth
Takin' my drugs in doses
**** my bitch by the pack
Came from the-Came from mud
First to put the hood on the jet
First to put thе hood on Molly
Then we put the hood on X
**** what a **** gotta say
I'm now sеcuring my bag
Trappin' in Atlanta
Bought three, four, five Phantoms
Drug dealers, murders, and the scammers
Crocodile Birkin for your mama
Fourty-seven racks on sandals
Burberry Mink on camera
Pour the Wock' down in the Fanta
Walk a **** down on camera
Ski mask cover my face up
Skull wallet chain, Santana
Show a real-real what you made of
Hit 'em in the top right now
Drankin' on Wock' right now
Clutchin' my Glock right now
Marni on my sock right now
Your **** give me mop right now
To finesse on the road outta town
Drink the pain up then smoke up the pound
Selling dope outta grandma house
Bust juugs at grandma house
Cut sixteen-hundred out a ounce
Bought a foreign, could barely pronounce
One chain and it cost 'bout a house
Had them all a couple fives then bounce
Go tomato on the guts, a Ferrari
Hit this new lick, I'm snatchin' Bugatti
Sippin' oil out the drank, it's exotic
Get paid just to talk out of pocket
Once you finish loading up, then you cock it
Think these bitches outta France got me cocky
Rappers take off with the lingo and chop it
Make me crush up the scene with no problem
Swearin' these **** gon' try me in Atlanta
Hopped out the Uber, next thing you know, I bought Uber
Hopped out the Uber, next thing you know, I bought Uber
Don't come in with the rumors, don't ask me nothin' you can Google
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you?)
Comin' in like, damn, where you get it from?
Comin' in like, damn, where you **** from?
Had just hopped up out the Uber
Next week, that man probably bought Uber
Don't wanna come at me startin' with a rumor
Matter fact, ask me nothin' you can Google
**** runnin' up a million being frugal
**** I was at yo' mama house, eating noodles ****

And we all wanna be happy
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy to you?)

And I know  with a tenant
And throw somethin', ain't somethin' I invented
Thought I had enough  get rented
 goin' dumb, pour some money in it
When the gun of sun, when I'm in it
Tinted, squint it, been it, y'all know it been a minute
Throwing in these 
Hold up, I'ma let you finish
'Pac goin' throw it up with a mini
I gave one song, count too many
Two mans hop out but I don't see any
How I'm gon' , leave you with me?
Dun-dun, come and get me
Throw the lights on and hit the getti
Four  now they hear me
Cocaine house round at Diddy's
Propane house like Minnie
Two night time like 50
Told my mama don't want many
Told my mama I'm winning
Tell 'em finna wanna live there
And we all wanna be happy
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan— (Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan—

When we done something, it's a movie
Probably get the job back at Louis
Probably got a nine, act a foolie
Someone actin' unruly
Pass out, wake up with a IV
I be—told my jeweler I'm too famous for the chain
Told my stylist I'm too famous for names
Told my jeweler I'm too famous for chains
Told MTV I'm too famous for the fame
Man, we ain't playin' no more games
Mortal Kombat and I finish you
Wanna throw me in the institute?
All you can do is salute

And we all wanna be happy
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan— (Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan—
Woo
