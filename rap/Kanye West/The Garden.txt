There's been a lot of change in our lives
Some would've guessed and some undefined
Must keep the faith in, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

Writin's on the wall around us (yeah-yeah)
Watchin' people all around us (yeah)
Gotta wake up to the call above us (Ooh-ooh-oh)
Then I know it's gon' be alright (Yeah-yeah)
It's comin' around, we're enlightened
Prayin' that we all stay guided
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find our way
We will weld this world, world back together
Let's make a way, we'll lead the way (Must)
Must keep the faith, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

Writin's on the wall around us
Watchin' people all around us
Gotta wake up to the call above us
Then I know it's gonna be alright
It's comin' back around, we're enlightened
Prayin' that we all stay guided
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find a way
Hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll find a way
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find a way, we'll find a way

We'll find our way like summer flows its way through fall
Allow love to wrap its wings around us all
Daylight
In the nighttime, don't cry yourself to sleep
I will be your everything
Stay patiently waiting for me (for me)
Let the harmony between you and I
Completely make us whole (make us whole)
Let me know (me know)
That you and I see the same picture (picture)
In that frame, with ya (with ya)
