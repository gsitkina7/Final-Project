Nebuchadnezzar's dreams
And in the second year of the rain of Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed, dreams
Where with his spirit was trouble
And his sleep break from him
Then the command, then the king commanded to call the magicians
And the astrologers and the sorcerers
And the chaldeans
For to shew the king His dreams
So they came and stood before the king
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams where his spirit was troubled
And his sleep break from him (Wooh, ah, ah, ah, ohh)
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed, dreams where his spirit was troubled
And his sleep break from him (Woah, ah, ah, ah, ah, woah)
