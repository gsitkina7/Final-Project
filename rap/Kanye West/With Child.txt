Boy, I ain't waitin' 'round
I ain't waitin' 'round for some handouts (Handouts)
I'ma always stand out, always stand out
That's hands down (Hands down, woo)
Better tell them boys, better tell them boys
Tell 'em "Stand down" (Stand down)
And that boy soft as hell, hell
'Till he got his man 'round (Man 'round)

Boy behave, ayy, Kobe, ayy, ayy
See the reason why they set him up
'Cause he ain't no slave, ayy
Swear the game cut throat
Cosby, set up, what? Shut up boy, shut up
Our lord has the bandwidth (Da, da, nah)
Please bless us with the bandwidth (Doo, doo, doo)
Stand with him, he a stand in
We just heard the new Black Star, it's a good time to be a black star
We the children, we the vision, Daytona, going NASCAR
Biden said you ain't black if you ain't vote for me and I ain't vote for him, so is that basis to cancel my black card?
'Cept for when Mom visit me ('Cept for when Mom visit me)
I can hear her whisperin', not too long, just visitin'
Finally in a position that they can't impeach
Finally a transition, I was once chained like tennis piece
He must want me to run, that's why I'm in this positionin'
God must want me the one, Holy Ghost and his Son
Boy, I ain't waitin' 'round
I ain't waitin' 'round for some handouts (Handouts)
I'ma always stand out, always stand out
That's hands down (Hands down, woo)
Better tell them boys, better tell them boys
Tell 'em "Stand down" (Stand down)
And that boy soft as hell, hell
'Till he got his man 'round (Man 'round)
