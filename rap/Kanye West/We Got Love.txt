We got love, love, love
You better believe it

I got house and a carriage, yeah
I got Black love and marriage, yeah
They gon' say you can’t have it, but
I'm like, "Don't kill the messenger"
We gon’ break the stigma up
Huxtables turned to Obamas
It ain't about where you been, where you from
What you got
It's all about love
Self-love is the best love
When you gon' take that wristband off?
That pity party been over
Don't need make-up to dress you up
I gave birth on the bathroom floor
Just me, Iman, and headphone cords
Don't let this life defeat you
I hope this message reach you
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I’m just chillin’ with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!

We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)

I live in abundance, love is the new money
I'm mentally wealthy, spiritually conscious
I’m fresh out of Onyx, I'm ballin', I'm ballin’
I play with the hunnids, love is the new money
That's my frequency, spark up, burn the sage
Clear the room, heal the hate, love is the new wave

Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is (Ahh!)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)

Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!
(Throw your hands up, throw your hands up)

Above all you keep your clarity
You keep your focus
You keep your sense of love
And you keep your sense of purpose
Those are, they're integral
You know, they're key
Happiness
You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world
But if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you know
If you can't be a person of integrity while having all these things
What does it matter?
What does it mean?
Your value is internal
Your value is internal
