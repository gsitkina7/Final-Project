So now ladies and gentlemen, this is star time
Are you ready for star time?

Life of the rich and gorgeous
Someone gonna be forging it
I told my dad I would have been aborted
If I wasn't the one that put the cord in
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
Now I get the order
Thumbing thumbing through my wallet
Automatic toilet, now that's the shit
Popping off with the orbit, I got ya' bitch
Let it go
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn
And if you're out in the crowd
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it (Don't you play no)
Don't you play with you

Let me fix my neck, chain on
Let me fix the check, games on
Let me thump a thump game on
And ain't nobody playing with him, no
Summertime rain with him, no
They all layin' with him now
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
No one wanna pray with him, no
Want it done, bathe in it now
Wanna get a raise with him now
Something down in nah-ney with 'em now
Like we always
Talk to me like we always
The illuminati
Dirt bike or a Kawasaki
Bottle up on a new party
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn
And if you're out in the crowd
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it (Don't you play no)
Don't you play with you

Oh, you been
Something I can you bitch
Only one and they don't forget
 we 'bout to get
Yeah I walk
Pop sampling
Hold on
Fall out all about
What y'all about?

Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn
And if you're out in the crowd
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it (Don't you play no)
Don't you play with you
With your praying hands
For you lil' niggas, I'm way advanced
And I don't write rhymes, I write tattoos
And when I die, they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
'Till they run up on a bad mood
Bitch, that's a bad move
Bitch, get out the way
Someone gonna get out today
And I know I was gone for a minute
But need to get out today
Now let us get this money
Sell it for  if I want to

Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn
And if you're out in the crowd
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it (Don't you play no)
Don't you play with you

Don't play, boy
Someone  what you made, boy
Hoppin' in the mansion
Waking around with a robe on
I could have started play, boy
Cause I married a playmate
When you stay eight
And they rate
I kinda want the nudes
Something for when I'm in that mood
Woo
