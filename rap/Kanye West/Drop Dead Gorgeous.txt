Woo, hoo, woo, hoo, woo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl is fine, haha, that girl fine

Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead

Yeah, I got a girl that's Gucci'd down straight off the project porches (Yeah)
Put her in a Porsche and made her look like a portrait (Yeah)
Put her in Church clothes, made her look corporate
While my construction worker hit a nigga with the forklift
Or if I bring her to the studio
You seen me with that one girl, you like, ''K got all the hoes''
Goddamn, she perfect, kill a nigga for her
Yes, I may look at the picture like ''Goddamn, she was worth it''
Man, that's something to work with, make Billy D. nervous
Jewelry and D-R-E, even she look at the surface
She don't cook or clean or give head, she being said ''Ow''
Do that and you'll be saying, ''True that, true that''
Take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke (Uh)
One look and murder she wrote (What?)
She drop dead gorgeous (What?), she drop dead


She drop dead gorgeous
She drop dead gorgeous
She drop dead gorgeous
She drop dead
Take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead
