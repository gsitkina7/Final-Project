Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
Ah, shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
Ah, shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Oh, never wanted it to roll away the stone
There's no road I've ever known
Never, never, never know
Today I'm feeling strong, baby
Today I did it all alone
I said I'm feeling really warm
So, baby, baby, baby, come on
Ã‰lan thoughts when your tons up, for 'em put your guns up
One dollar ones-up, mama put your ones up
Say they wilding for

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV sta-tion, oh
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
I'm so tired of all the lights, I'm so tired of all the lies
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
I'm so tired of all the cries, I'm so tired of sinful light
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Vore the night
And maybe you'll get away tonight
And maybe then the night's alright
And maybe you'll want something of mine
And we'll get on and get by
And maybe we'll learn to belong too
And maybe we'll learn to will mine
'Cause I can't depend on the now new
And these niggas don't come tonight
Roll your guns up, roll your guns up
They got guns so you're gonna come
Roll up your guns up, and nothin' left to do, but
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV sta-tion
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
And I'm so tired of all the lies, and I'm so tired of all the cries
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
And I'm so tired of some that lie, I'm on the night just on a ride
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Alright, sometimes the day's too long
Where would you go?
Somebody known too long
Ooh, and now you know
So I can't keep 'em tonight, you want to?
A'ight, oh, oh, oh
And make another song 'til drift off, 'til I, 'til I, I
Shoot up the station, TV station
Who knew there was nothing to do and everything to lose
And there's not nothing left to do, but

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
I'm going to, and if you're with me
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
If you're tired of all the lies, if you're tired of all the cries
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
Now if your signs aren't all that nice n' if you find someone for life
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
And if you're tired of all the lies n' then you're tired of all the cries
It won't consign until all we die
And when you drab I'm still alive, still alive
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, yeah, yeah
