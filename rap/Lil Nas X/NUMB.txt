Time is runnin', it's numbin' (Time is runnin', it's numbin')
Are they really responding? (Can they hit me up?)
I wanna know if I go and do a lil' show, will they show up, man are they even coming?

Is this shit really a trance, I don't know dude
Do I really got fans, I have no clue
Gettin' smacked about this shit, aw, that's my whole mood
Grab the MAC and get the clip, call that the Pro Tools
I should switch my sound up, and maybe more will listen in
Fans will start to mound up, like Christians say I'm sickenin'
I'm sick of bitchin' and bein' stuck up in this kitchen
And spittin' bout shit that I did, and shit that I didn't
Let's get it, how fast is he really comin' up
Right by milli's, but I'm really stuck here eatin' philly subs
"Carry On" gettin' plays, mixtapе, it ain't get no luck
YouTube subs got me seein' why I еven test my luck
Man, my nigga, where my hits at? (I ain't got 'em)
Where my respect? (At the bottom)
Slit my wrist all cause of problems
Now I'm pissed off, little toddler
Shit, they never let the gas get to my head
They don't like my ass, I'm just Lil Nas X, no respect, uh
