Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh

So you see, one day, one day
'Fore you leave, today, today
Yeah, you know my heart can't take no more
So, baby, take it all, leave it all on the floor
So, you see, one day, one day
I'll be the one who walked away
Four five, six seven, each nights, away
My eyes ain't lost, I just can't wait
You told me that I was someone up in Holly
But now goodbye, he's home, and that's a naughty
But everybody ain't the same, you noticed me

So you see, one day, one day
'Fore you leave, today, today
Yеah, you know my heart can't take no more
So, baby, takе it all, leave it all on the floor
So, you see, one day, one day
I'll be the one who walked away

I've seen better days, sleepin' all alone
So I know, if you know, someone needin'
I know you been the same, it's a no
I was hopin' you could stay here for the weekend

Woo, ooh, ooh
You know I don't feel right, what you feel like
Woo, ooh, ooh
You know I don't feel right, what you feel like
So, you see, one day, one day
(I can't help but feel like it's over, I just feel like it's over)
'Fore you leave, today, today
(I can't help but feel like it's over, I just feel like it's over)
Yeah, you know my heart can't take no more
(I can't help but feel like it's over, I just feel like it's over)
So, baby, take it all, leave it all on the floor
So, you see, one day, one day
(I can't help but feel like it's over, I just feel like it's over)
I'll be the one who walked away

One day, one day
So, you see, one day, one day
(I can't help but feel like it's over, I just feel like it's over)
'Fore you leave, today, today
(I can't help but feel like it's over, I just feel like it's over)
