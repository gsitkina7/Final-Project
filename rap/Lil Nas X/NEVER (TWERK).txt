All the lonely nights (Yeah)
I spent alone  (Let's go)
(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

See I never gave a fuck, never will
Poppin' pills, ain't no Benadryl
I'm the prince like Will
Moving in with Uncle Phil
Ay, ay, twerk that ass, yuh
Twerk, twerk, twerk that ass, yuh
Ay, twerk that ass, yuh
Twerk that, ay

I'm the illest motherfucker on this planet
If I plan it, then it's getting handled
Don't you understand it?
Ay, where's your manners?
My flow go bananas
Straight out of Atlanta
In the ghost, call that bitch Danny
I ain't talkin' bout Danny Tanner
Yeah, I been rapping for three years
This shit is easy to me
You niggas probably hungry
But y'all not greedy likе me
So when I-
When I sеnd that text that I made it
Man, you should be mad that I'm flexing and you hating

Yeah, I said I
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Never gave a fuck, never will
Poppin' pills
Ain't no fucking Benadryl
I'm the prince, I'm the Will
Moving in with Uncle Phil
Yeah, yeah
Rolling with the Rugrats
Pussy, where your drugs at?
Strolling in your city tryna find out where the plug at
Rolling with the Rugrats
Money in the rug mat
Funny you a bum, always asking "Where my hug at?"

You a lame nigga, been knew
I hang with them reds and the blue too
Don't make me disconnect you like a Bluetooth
Leave your whole body red, nigga-
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
