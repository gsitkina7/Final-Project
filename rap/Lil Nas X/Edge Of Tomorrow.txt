Ta, da, da, da, da
Ra, da, da, da
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You said I wasn't strong enough
You said I wouldn't land on both feet
And no, I wasn't mad at all (Ha)
But now, I must admit it broke me
But all the talking, everybody saying what I could be
I talked to god, and god started screaming out to me
You see gold in your eyes
It's raining now on your touch
You see tomorrow if I
Who said you had to quit now?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
And I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And I can't breathe
I can't breathe

But I got a ride back to Emerald Sea
And put a pat on my back
Don't tell me "make this" and don't you tell me "make that"
I'm never gon' do what you want so don't ask
So you can, hold me dead, in the grave
If I die, I'ma be here forever
I'm not lеaving, got my key in
The car started chasing my dеmons

You see gold in your eyes
It's raining now on your touch
You see tomorrow if I
Who said you had to quit now?
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Now, now)
And I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Now, now)
And I can't breathe
I can't breathe

(I can't breathe, no)
And I can't breathe
I can't breathe
(I can't breathe, no)
Who said you had to quit now?
