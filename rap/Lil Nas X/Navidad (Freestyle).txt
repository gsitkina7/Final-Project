DeCicco, DeCicco, DeCicco, DeCicco (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Git, git, git, git, git

It's-It's-It's Christmas, richness, on my wishlist
If he talk shit, he get hit, with the quickness
'Bout my business, tight circle, ain't no hiss-hiss
When I leave the game, guarantee that they gon' miss this
Feliz Navidad
I need that brand new Audi Mas
Need weed, I'm a rasta and a rockstar
Gimme that, I'm on my hot guitar
Fabulous-o
Say Feliz Navidado
Si, está nevado
Me? I like to run shit
Grab the guccabando
(Did he run, did he run?)
Chop, chop, a gun, they runnin' from me
(Did he run, did he run?)
I-I still runnin' like I'm Sonic
Breeze through the runway
Clean, check the feng shui
Just dropped 'No Love'
Got a shoutout on Beyoncé
Shoutout to my nigga Skai
We finna be on, ay
I just keep on droppin' hits
Go cop that Carry On, ay

(DeCicco)
DeCicco on that beat
I hang and I bang with them thangs in the street
My name, yeah, I rang, when I sang, they repeat (Git, git, git, git, git, git, git)
For da' rings by my chain
You get paid for a feet
Pop up
Pussyboy, get your guap up
How'd you flop?
Pussy nigga, you got locked up
Get your clock up
Know that Patek been stocked up
You get shocked up
Pick with you? I call my Glock up
I'm really done in niggas
Al Capone'in niggas
I don't fuck with no pigs, unless I'm farmin' nigga
I like harmin' niggas
You Pee-wee Herman niggas
Double etendre
Yeah, the Usher
Burn and burnin' niggas

DeCicco on that beat
I hang and I bang with them thangs in the street
My name, yeah, I rang, when I sang, they repeat
For da' rings by my chain
You get paid for a feet
De-DeCicco on that beat
I hang and I bang with them thangs in the street
My name, yeah, I rang, when I sang, they repeat
For da' rings by my chain
You get paid for a feet
