We still in Paris with it (bonjour, my boy)
I need a French lover
Some slight, some undercover, just one night of some good fuckin'
My big bro, I seen his passport, and this motherfucker
Hardheaded , hardheaded but I still love him
Look look, we been in the club getting litty
My niggas get gritty when that DJ drop that vidy (vid, vid, vid)
I'm fucked up, I'm shitty
I'm picking out my pick me, I only fuck if he pretty
The fans outside the peninsula wanted a Tik-Tok and some quick pictures
I gave them that and a big hug and a big smile and said, "I fuck with ya"
I'm grown now, it's my jordan year
I'm  through my bar mitzvah, I'm reckless
My cologne spray cost 4k like a large picture
I'm just thanking God that thе flight made it through
It's a different stylе of the white, red, and blue
I was in my spot making music with my crew
Niggas out in Paris, baby, comment allez-vous?

Yeah
LA nigga just hit me on FaceTime
We ain't even know the LA time, but time zones ain't the reason I wanna talk, I just wanna talk on FaceTime
I was just in love for the first time, but I ain't like the music, I think they should bring mine
Run me that Industry Baby, that Dolla Sign Slime, or that Scoop in the club
But if I walk in that bitch to promoters and bookers, them boys need to run me my bucks
I do not talk to a nigga for more than a week, if I do than you lucky as fuck
I'm out in Paris and looking for love
