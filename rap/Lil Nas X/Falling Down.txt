Things, things ain't good
Tell me have you ever seen my 
It goes things before
But fun and all, fun and all makes shit grows

And maybe we don't know the runnin' days at these times, these times
And maybe we should've thought a little longer, oh, done it little stronger and

Down, falling down
Come on and hold me down, falling down, falling down
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
Da, da, da, da, da
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
Da, da, da, da, da
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
I know just what you just think
We open every dream 
On and on and on
Tough on 
I didn't know what you told  and you , mmm
I just said come and roll in, think about nothin', moanin'
Tell her make up her mind
I done made another 
Takin' in serotonin,  my 
And I just wanted it in the night, you been way too

And maybe we don't know the runnin' days at these times, these times
And maybe we should've thought a little longer, oh, done it little stronger and

Down, falling down
Come on and hold me down, falling down, falling down
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
Da, da, da, da, da
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
Da, da, da, da, da
Can't see you see it's all falling down?

If you want to hold me now, hold me now, 
I'll never know what to do, it's all unknown to me
If you , if you ever go to me
Down, falling down
Come on and hold me down, falling down, falling down
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
Da, da, da, da, da
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
Da, da, da, da, da
Can't see you see it's all falling down?
