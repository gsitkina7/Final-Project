(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Yeah, I-
I feel like layin' some pipe
G-Give me some pink hole that's ripe
Don't be pissed or polite
Give me a hell of a night
Don't call me baby, you'll call me your daddy tonight
'Cause I know it, you hit the scene for somebody you can hoe with
Y'know a nigga like me on his race shit
Like, I see shit but, I don't ever sight shit
But, aight shit
Please say you want me bad
Won't you come next to me
I know you must not hear my lies
Come get the rest of me

Nah-nah-nah, no
Nah-nah, nah-nah
Y'know
Nah-nah, no
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Uh, n-n-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah
Nah-nah
Nah-nah
Y'know
Nah-nah, no
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Uh, n-n-nah-nah-nah-nah

Uh, Iggs!
Give you what you want
Give you, give you what you want
You will never get to cuff me
I'm too good at breakin' laws
Party with the pussycat, I'm lookin' like a doll
I'm a different kind of Pedigree when dealin' with a dog
Tell me what you like
Tell me, tell me what you like
Everyday I get a message of you beggin' me to slide
Textin' me, sweatin' me, like can we spend some time
Thirsty in my presence, but I guess that's no surprise
Please say you want me bad
Won't you come next to me
I know you must not hear my lies
Come get the rest of me

Nah-nah-nah, no
Nah-nah, nah-nah
Y'know
Nah-nah, no
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Uh, n-n-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah
Nah-nah
Nah-nah
Y'know
Nah-nah, no
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Uh, n-n-nah-nah-nah-nah

Oh, I'm sorry
I might end up taking you home
I'm sorry
I'm not tryna be on my own
