Every song, every dream filled with hell from beyond
As I'm sinkin', I relive the story
Every try, every breakthrough, and every cry
As I'm sinkin', I relive the story

Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fadin', replayin'
These thoughts I thought while sinkin' down
Oh, never forget me
And evеrything I've done
Tears running dry, shattеred inside, but I still gotta smile
As I'm sinkin', I relive the story
Glitter comes off, battered and blue, but I gotta go on
As I'm singin', I rewrite my story

Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fadin' (Fadin'), replayin' (Mmm)
These thoughts I thought while sinkin' down
Oh-oh-oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
