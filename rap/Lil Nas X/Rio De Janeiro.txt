Nigga, I just met a baddie
She dropped the pin, sent that addy
She call me her papi, daddy
She poppin' if niggas rattin'
I copped her the Patek
She jumpin' up so ecstatic
Her pussy plumb, told me pat it
No Donald Trump, but I grab it
I say, "Spicy mamacita"
It's really nice to meet ya
Take a sip of this tequila
Then let's fly to Puerto Rico
Or Rio de Janeiro
My real name is Montero
I'm stackin' them dineros
'Bout my cheese, I'm 'bout my queso!
I say, "Spicy mamacita"
It's really nice to meet ya
Take a sip of this tequila
Then let's fly to Puerto Rico
Or Rio de Janeiro
My real name is Montero
I'm stackin' them dineros
'Bout my cheese, I'm 'bout my queso!

W-w-when I met her she said, "What's yo' net worth?"
Like to get her cookie ate, said, "Rookie, how yo' neck work?"
Said she used to work in finance, nigga, JG Wentworth
She kill 'em with class, shoot they ass in a red skirt, dead hearse
Gotta lotta cholos, that'll steal for her
Even mo' doh', screamin' YOLO
They will go and kill for her
Her pussy on Marco Polo
Think I gotta feel for her
Say, "Lil Nas, you gettin' big"
"Can't wait to yo' Billboards", real noise
I say, "Spicy mamacita"
It's really nice to meet ya
Take a sip of this tequila
Then let's fly to Puerto Rico
