Uh
Y'all know I can take it back one time
Yeah

You know these niggas really hate it when you doing you
I made it through my situations and my issues, uh
I'm here to make it, don't fire no need for faking
No liar, I'm in the latest
Retire, I be the greatest
See I, I had it rough but that ain't finna change shit
Often they be up, on my Carter 3 Wayne shit
Gotta switch it up, I can't stay in one lane bitch
They talk to me but money is my only language
I'm dangerous, I can make these grown men cry
A nigga spittin' like he rеally from the EY
Say greetings to pretend it's who just camе by
Man I know they kidding when they sayin' that they spittin' fire
See I'm the illest in these mothafuckin' streets
If they hear my flow, then they copy off of me
They out here just tryna be hot, I'm tryna reach the top spot
The Drake, the Jay, Biggie and Pac, yeah
Got it, and if I don't then I'ma get it
When I get my first milli', I'ma have to split it
Pass the whiff down just so I can say I did it
Get my paws all around
Celebratin', I can feel it

You know these niggas really hate it when you doing you
I made it through my situations and my issues, uh
I'm here to make it, don't fire no need for faking
No liar, I'm in the latest
Retire, I be the greatest
You know these niggas really hate it when you doing you
I made it through my situations and my issues, uh
Let's go
