Take me
Take me

Why don't you take me
Take me on tour now
Only wanna share my love
Please save me a song
Why don't you take me
Take me on tour now
Only wanna fall in love
Please sing me your songs
Man,  is all I want
Cordially conversations is all I want
And my God we can last so long
It'd be solo sleepin' on my own
I fell in love with your soul and your flame
I swear to fuckin' God I feel like you're talkin' to me
And I was waitin' on you, now that wait is over guess I'll never know

And there's shit I've been through
So done waitin' for you
Only wanna sit here whеn you want
Oh, you wanna hit me while I'm gone?
As I sit in this room, I can't think about you
Only wanna sit hеre when you want
Only wanna hit me, well I'm gone

Why don‘t you take me
Take me on tour now
Only wanna share my love
Please save me a song

Only wanna share my love, please
Only wanna share my love, please
