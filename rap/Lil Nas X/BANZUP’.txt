Run that money counter, baby, mhm, hmm, hmm
Pour that shit up, Trvpyyy

When I get some wins, I'm complacent
Might blow up go buy a new place and
Right now, I still live with my mom and my dad
But I’ll skeet on your face in that basement
See, I fuck with crackers and Haitians
I'm rapping, they say he gon' make it
I really think ain’t no more rules to this rap shit
I really think Josh could be Drake'ing
They thinkin' that I got hella' guap
Did you love me 'fore I got it? Not
Gucci on my socks
It's too cold, I can't take it off
I see hella people watching me because they envy a
Nigga moving up, I got my old friends acting friendlier
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(Run me my paper)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(No time for haters)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(I told my neighbors)
Run up them bands up
(Can you pardon that water vapor?)

When I get the guap, I'm complacent (’Placent)
You watch what you say, when you say it (Say it)
Lil’ nigga, I might just be friends with yo plug
If I give him the paper he lace it (He lace it)
See, I might get head in a Wraith and (In a Wraith and)
Go plot for the world domination ('Mination)
See, I’m tryna get to the tippity-top
To where Kanye and Jay-Z adjacent
I'm poppin', like, I'm already on
Turn this up, this yo favorite song
Lotta niggas on, trashy songs
They won’t last too long
'18 set me up for '19
It's gon' be a killer year
Was rich in my past life
All this money look familiar
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(Run me my paper)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(No time for haters)
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up
(I told my neighbors)
Run up them bands up
(Can you pardon that water vapor?)
