Workin' so damn hard, it's become a habit
Could've got a crib out in Calabasas
Could've settled down, could've start relaxin'
But when you get the crown, you should never pass it
Yuh
Paparazzi's on my toes
Tell 'em get my fit lil' bitch, don't get too close
Oh, oh-oh
Paparazzi's on my toes
When you're rich like this, they swear you sold ya soul
Oh

Fuck the scene, where the cash?
I'm a fiend for the bag
I'm a money-hungry, ego-driven, megalomaniac
I'm a uh, I've been uh
I've been humble, let me back
All my singlеs go to diamond, double all they triple plaquе

And you think I'm lucky, I know
'Cause you only see me in my glow
When I walk around, my head is high as my dough
So, you never see me at my lows

Workin' so damn hard, it's become a habit
Could've got a crib out in Calabasas
Could've settled down, could've start relaxin'
But, when you get the crown, you should never pass it
Yuh
Paparazzi's on my toes
Tell 'em get my fit lil' bitch, don't get too close
Oh, oh-oh
Paparazzi's on my toes
When you're rich like this, they swear you sold ya soul
Oh

I could tell you're lookin' down on me
I could tell you wouldn't count on me
I can tell you'll start rootin' when you see an underdog get the crown on me
I could tell you're lookin' down on me
Down on me, down on me
Fuck it, still I put the crown on me
Crown on me, crown on me

And you think I'm lucky, I know
'Cause you only see me in my glow
When I walk around, my head is high as my dough
So, you never see me at my lows

Workin' so damn hard, it's become a habit
Could've got a crib out in Calabasas
Could've settled down, could've start relaxin'
But, when you get the crown, you should never pass it
Yuh
Paparazzi's on my toes
Tell 'em get my fit lil' bitch, don't get too close
Oh, oh-oh
Paparazzi's on my toes
When you're rich like this, they swear you sold ya soul (Yeah)
Oh (Yeah)

Mmm, mmm
I swear to God, they swear you sold your soul
Mmm, mmm
Worked so hard, til' they swear you sold your soul
