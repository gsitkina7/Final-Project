My little baby won't stay long, he been gone, I've been on my own
My little baby won't stay long, he been gone, I've been on my own

Hey, can we please turn off the lights
Don't need you to see my closet all tonight
Got the teeth, I'm totally honest
And I'm like, yeah, it's no surprise

Insecurities, all over me, I'm too afraid you'll leave
Insecurities, ride along with me, I'm too afraid you'll
Go away, soon
I'm going up with angels
Dark feeling, drug feeding, constantly
Ya see the outfit, oh wow
Drugs see me, I'm feeling confident
What do you like baby boy?
And hey, sexy talk to me
Know you wanna sext me
Hey wait, sexy, walk with me
C'mon baby, let's leave

Can we please turn off the lights
Don't need you to see my closet all tonight
Got the teeth, I'm totally honest
And I'm like, yeah, it's no surprise

Insecurities, all over me, I'm too afraid you'll leave
Insecurities, ride along with me, I'm too afraid you'll
Go away, soon
I'm going up with angels


Insecurities, all over me, I'm too afraid you'll leave
Insecurities, ride along with me, I'm too afraid you'll
Go away, soon
I'm going up with angels
