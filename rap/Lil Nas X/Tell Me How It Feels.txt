Tell me how it feels you know you've made it
Tell me how it feels to feel you're on top of the world
Tell me how it feels to know it can all go away in one minute, just one minutes
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels to have the whole family love you
Tell me how it feels to know you're a favorite
Tell me how it feels to watch them give up on themselves, 
Tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels to come out to the world
Tеll me how it feels to put yourself first
Tell mе how it feels knowing you'd kill for approval, you know you would, you know you would
Tell me how it feels
How's it feel?
How's it feel?
How's it feel?
How's it feel?
Old Town Road is one of the biggest songs of the year, if not, the biggest
I knew for a fact that this song would take me to another level
But, I can't say that I knew that'd it'd be worldwide or nationwide
Thank you, thank you so much, uh
This is my first award ever, uh
