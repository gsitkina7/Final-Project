Swear to God, I seen an angel up above (Ooh, ooh)
Whilst I was whippin' and dippin' up through these Beverly backstreets
I'm tryna keep it realer from the jump
But I can't share my feelings if you ain't ever ask me
You actin' like a stranger and you know it (And you know it)
We fightin' over nothin' in the back of the backseat (Hmm)
She tell me turn my anger into love (Girl, is it love?)
Before I end up missin' out on what made me happy

Well how do you know how I feel if you ain't here still?
Yeah, how do you know how I feel if it ain't been real?
Yeah, how you know? How you know?
Baby tell me how you know
How you know? How you know?
Baby tell me, oh
Yeah, how do you know how I feel if it ain't been real?
Oh, no
Breakdown after breakdown
After thinkin' I'm over you now
Every time I reach out to find my own self
I only sit down and find a new low
How could I have known?
You're lonely, ain't there no room for me?
Any story of us is just a dream
How could I have known?
Yeah, you lonely and you don't need a thing
But it hurts me to know that thing's me, yeah

Well how do you know how I feel if you ain't here still?
Yeah, how do you know how I feel if it ain't been real?
Yeah, how you know? How you know?
Baby tell me how you know
How you know? How you know?
Baby tell me, oh
Yeah, how do you know how I feel if it ain't been real?
Oh, no
