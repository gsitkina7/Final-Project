If I switched my sound, would you pardon me and let me hold a gun to it?
Run to next town, with the thought of me, the pit of the anomaly
It's crazy but it's true, there's a thing between me and you, only if you would've knew
What my mind goes through, living in the future, watch how I'ma do ya

'Cause myself is watching
You knew just how I felt
And myself is watching
I'll give 'em a story to tell
'Cause I'm waiting for you
'Cause I'm waiting for you
Oh, I must go to make the change
I must go to make the change
Oh, I must go to make the change
That's how it's gotta be anyways

I been knockin', knockin'-knockin' on every block and avenuе
I'm about to do what's bound to happen and I can not do ride by you
I been knockin', knockin'-knockin' on evеry block and avenue
How you gon' say what's right for me when you don't really know what's right for you?

And myself is watching
You knew just how I felt
And myself is watching
I'll give 'em a story to tell

'Cause I'm waiting for you
'Cause I'm waiting for you
Oh, I must go to make the change
I must go to make the change
Oh, I must go to make the change
That's how it's gotta be anyways
'Cause I'm waiting for you
'Cause I'm waiting for you
Be anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I just need someone to love
Be—Be—Be anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
