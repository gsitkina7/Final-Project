Ah, December, my favorite time of year
And I think you all know why, ho, ho, ho
But here, let me explain it to you with a song

It's that wonderful, special time of year
I fly around the world spreading Christmas cheer
I ride on my sleigh with my eight reindeer
And now, my friend Santa Nas X is here
Thank you Santa, my bitch, man, I'm ready to party
And I'm flyin' in my sleigh while I'm chuggin' Bacardi
And I got a big bag which you already know
Got a couple candy canes for my ho-ho-hoes

Ah, anyway
I live at the North Pole with my wife
And many happy elves, it's a happy life
I have rosy cheeks and I wear a red suit
And I top it all off with my big black boots

F*** your black boots, man, I got Jimmy Choos
And I got a Lamborghini, just kiddin', I got two
I'm decked out in chrome and I **** on the daily
I don't give presents, bitch, I make the kids pay me

Maybe we should stop doing the song
Hell no, you red-nosed bastard, I'm just gettin' started
Okay

When I stop by, give me cookies and milk
Nah, I can't eat that ****, boy, I got a new grill
Have a little egg nog, but not too much
F*** your nog, gimme Henny in a big-ass cup
I've gotta be honest, you might deserve coal
I'ma turn that **** to diamond and buy the North Pole
I should have done a song with Rudolph or Frosty
You like to be nice, well, I like to get naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty, yeah
Let's get naughty, turn up the track (Naughty, naughty)
Grab my sack while I count these stacks (Naughty, naughty)
Don't need reindeer, that's a fact (Naughty, naughty)
Got my hoes out front and some presents in the back (Naughty)
And **** your stockin' stuffin'  (Naughty, naughty)
Nobody's gettin' nothin' (Naughty, naughty)

Alright, I've-I've heard enough
This isn't what Christmas is all about
Christmas is about presents under the tree and Rudolph and gingerbread men
It's about tradition and lights and whispering what you want while you sit on my lap
Oh, you nasty, huh?
No, no, no, that's not what I meant (Yeah)

Let's get naughty, turn up the track (Naughty, naughty)
Grab my sack while I count these stacks (Naughty, naughty)
Don't need reindeer, that's a fact (Naughty, naughty)
Got my hoes out front and some presents in the back
If Claus and Nas are here to stay
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays (Days, days, days, days)
Okay, go stream "HOLIDAY" now
