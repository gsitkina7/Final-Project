Ayy, bitch, I dropped out, huh
They didn't see the bigger picture, now they cropped out
I just made a fucking hit, didn't have to pop out
Bitch, you just now rootin' for me 'cause I got clout (Pop, pop, pop)
Finish line, huh, finna cross it, yeah, I'm trying, huh
You a worker, what? Gimme fries, lemon-lime
No, I ain't ever gettin' caught if I commit a crime
I tell the jury I was at home eatin' clementine
I got all these problems like I'm Jay-Z but it's 60, uh
Nobody to guide me, hope this label never trick me, uh
To keep it a hunnid, I can't split this fifty-fifty, uh
I blew by myself, so I might need my riches filthy, uh
Soakin' up all this fame, huh
Old Town just banged, huh
I just hopped in this industry, I think I opened up my own lane, huh
And you know what's real crazy? Huh
Parents told me I was lazy, huh
Was pushin' shit on the internet, now I'm up there with Lil Baby, uh
Splash, splash, splash, splash, splash, I keep scorin'
Don't send me that link, lil' nigga, you know that it's boring
Crazy how quick I woke all these niggas up from snoring
Crazy how sick they gon' be when I really start soarin'

Ayy, bitch, I dropped out, huh
They didn't see the bigger picture, now they cropped out
See I just made a fucking hit, didn't have to pop out
Bitch, you just now rootin' for me 'cause I got clout (Pop, pop, pop)
