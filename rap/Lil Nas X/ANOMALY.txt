Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, my everything

You could've been my everything
We could've had a wedding ring
I thought you were the one for me
My heaven sent anomaly
I know you been working 9 to 5, doin' overtime
Chiefing on your life, missing all the vibes
I never thought about you, you call me all the time
I left you in Atlanta, that caught you by surprise
If I thought love wasn't so hard, I'd be your everything
I know everything you want, I'd be your everything
'Cause you are my love, my anomaly
And I wanted to givе you everything
I know evеrything you want, I'd be your everything

You were at the party with your best friend
Got lit off the drank, with me on your brain
Now you're getting faded every weekend
You're tryna forget, I'm stuck in your head
You think about all the things we used to do (Ayy, ayy)
It's gotta be hard since I don't think of you (Ayy, ayy)
Yeah, baby, I don't got the time, yeah
So now I'm flying
So long, so long

If I thought love wasn't so hard, I'd be your everything
I know everything you want, I'd be your everything
'Cause you are my love, my anomaly
And I wanted to give you everything
I know everything you want, I'd be your everything

Two things I like to see
Love for you, but not from me
Too negative to leave
Love makes me feel way too weak
