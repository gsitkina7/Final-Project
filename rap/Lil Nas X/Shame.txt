Niggas really on my dick, that's a shame
I don't even know your name, give a fuck who you claim
Nigga, fuck your gang-gang, that clout be the blame
For these sorry ass rap niggas chasin' all the fame

Give me a bag, bet you I fill it
Slide me the beat, bet you I kill it
Niggas is mad, I'm on my chill shit
Haters not sweet, they really bitter
Now when I really take off
Hope you get mad then you feel it
'Cause my name is getting hot
Bitch, it's poppin' out the skillet
Where you think you at?
This Atlanta, lay you on your back
You ain't on the map, stop the cap
You can't really rap
Using ghostwriters? Disrespect
What the fuck is that?
Always putting shit on your set
Where the fuck they at?
You a lame nigga
You a bitch nigga
You a snitch nigga, not cool
I don't fuck with ya
My pockets gettin' richer
My pockets, they be litter
I hit it, I'm no pitcher
Got more cheese than picture

Niggas really on my dick, that's a shame
I don't even know your name, give a fuck who you claim
Nigga, fuck your gang-gang, that clout be the blame
For these sorry ass rap niggas chasin' all the fame

Give me a bag, bet you I fill it
Slide me the beat, bet you I kill it
Niggas is mad, I'm on my chill shit
Haters not sweet, they really bitter
Now when I really take off
Hope you get mad then you feel it
'Cause my name is getting hot
Bitch, it's poppin' out the skillet
Niggas got jokes? Well, I'm on your ass
Niggas want smoke? Get ya chimney smashed
Don't feature me on your song
Promise nigga, you will get trashed
I'm Michael Phelps with that tool
Don't let your whole team get splashed
"Damn, he's rash!"
Nah, that's just how I react
In the Maybach, let my seat back
Glove compartment where the piece at
In Bahamas, where the sea at
They tell a nigga to relax
Nah, I can't do that
'Cause I gotta watch my back
They will never catch me lack

Niggas really on my dick, that's a shame
I don't even know your name, give a fuck who you claim
