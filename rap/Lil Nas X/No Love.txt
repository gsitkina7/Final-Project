I don't wanna be without you, babe (Bitch)
I don’t want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe (Young Skai, fuck these niggas talking 'bout?)
I don’t want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say (Xtravulous)
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way (Woah)

I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew
No love, more drugs
No love, more drugs
But, I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew, ayy
No drugs, more love
No drugs, more lo—
Uh, yeah, I lead you on
Wish I could speak my feelings without running to a song
Yeah, you told me 'bout your mom, that shit ate me up
I could tell you need a shoulder, still didn't give a fuck
I could never get enough, of shittin' on people and just regrettin' it
Barely giving respect, but I want respect, just expecting it
Worried about my future, I’m burning bridges affecting it
People who show me love, I always end up neglecting
You thinking you made me do it, get to you, can’t get through it
I know you peepin' my pages, I know you peepin’ my music
I know you listening now, find it interesting now
Shit, if I was you, I'd probably feel sickened now
'Cause I left without even saying, you probably thought I was playing
Was I okay or alright, you probably was out here praying
You wanted the best for me, used to get dressed for me
But I can't be with you, I’m addressing my destiny, uh

I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew
No love, more drugs
No love, more drugs
But, I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew, ayy
No drugs, more love
No drugs
Ooh
I need more drugs, ain't no love good for me
I'ma need to be all on my own, think it's good for me
Ooh
I need more drugs, ain't no love good for me
I'ma need to be all on my own, think it's good for me
Good for me

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way
