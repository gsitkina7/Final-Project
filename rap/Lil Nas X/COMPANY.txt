Oh-ho
Oh-ho
Nah, nah, nah
(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Ayo, yo quiero get higher than stilettos
And they call me Montero
I'll light you white and yellow 'cause
I know you need some company
I know you need some company
I know you need some company
I know you need some company

I got that boof comin' in from Chicago (Chicago)
I burst it up in my Murcielago (Oh)
Man, I'm in Greystone, smoking on gelato
But smoking Greystone weed in a gala
Okay, too stoned, I'm lookin' like who gon' hit it?
Too stoned, I'm lookin' like Snoop Dogg, gimme it
Too stoned, I might fuck a freak whore
Man, I might leave here tonight with a gringo (Okay)

Ayo, yo quiero get higher than stilettos (Mhm)
And they call me Montero (Mhm)
I'll light you white and yеllow 'cause (Yeah)

I know you need some company (Yеah)
I know you need some company (You heard, yeah)
I know you need some company (Yeah)
I know you need some company
Meet 'em on the scene, I'm loud
Pass some shit, it's stressin' me
Got this girl, she soothin' me, right
Same things I find but I need a remedy
Watch me while I inhale God
Fly and count the stars on his feet
This the element that makes a nigga me
Catch me selling off the heaven pleasantly
I send all rage in fly

Ayo, yo quiero get higher than stilettos (Mhm)
And they call me Montero (Mhm)
I'll light you white and yellow 'cause (Mhm)

I know you need some company (Mhm)
I know you need some company
I know you need some company (Mhm, ay)
I know you need some company (Ay, ay)

I'm surfin' waves, gettin' paid with my eyes closed
I'm makin' plays, spittin' game to some bad hoes
I'm at a stage in a maze at the Ozzo
Lately, I've been on the high where they can't go
I never ask for more than I deserve (You know it's the)
You know it's the truth
