Uh
Get it, get it, I went and did it again
Rip it, flip it, they say I'm switchin' on friends
They say I'm trippin', forestallin' myself within
I only trip when I trip and fall in that Benz
I'ma bake the feature for the right pricing
Cake the beat, I'm just the right icing
See, I'm inspired by Neil deGrasse Tysons
They inspired by squealers that's doing lifings
I get three hours of sleep, just to get better
These cowards, they out here sour at me, petty vendettas
I ain't ate right or took a pee, waitin' for cheddar
Workin' late night, oh, it's just me, David the letter-man
C'mon girl, get up
Come a little bit
C'mon girl, get up
Come a little bit (Bit, bit)
My whole life I was under it!
All-
Che-che-check

Uh, so I'll be damned if I let a pussy take it from me
I'm the man, I'm the rookie, finna make the money
I make 'em dance, throw ya hands up and shake it for me
I'm advanced, man, my fans out here waitin' for me
So I'll be damned if I let a pussy take it from me
I'm the man, I'm the rookie, finna make the money
I make 'em dance, throw ya hands up and shake it for me
I'm advanced, man, my fans out here waitin' for me

Uh, I'm doing better so petty shit I just let it go
I'm more focused on leaving sofas to Mexico
Touring Europe and Africa, buzz around the globe
"Nas, can I get back to ya?" bitch, the sound of dough
Is all that I hear
Bitch, I'm really spittin' now, this is my career
Shoutout to the labels flaking on me, fuck they ears
You just lost your best player, 'Bron and Cavaliers, disappear! Uh!
I came to do it
I came to fucking pursue it
They showin' love in this bitch
'Cause I'm blowin' up and they knew it would happen
In this rappin', I'm the new captain
I sat back, perfected my craft while niggas was laughing
Uh
