Can you make time?
Know I take it all to heart
So please don’t break mine
Never hurted more before I called you eight times
In this jungle, I can't break vines, yeah
It's all good, yeah, it's all good

You don't want me here then you should just let me know
Pedal to the metal, get the hell up out the door
Thought you felt the same but I think you played me, oh, huh
It's all good, yeah, it's all good
Can you make timе?
Know I take it all to heart
So pleasе don’t break mine
Never hurted more before I called you eight times
In this jungle, I can't break vines, yeah
It's all good, yeah, it's all good
