Just stop your tapping
You don't want to go rubbing with me
No time to have you chapping
I've get new rinses
Won't ya get me some quinces
I'm slathering 'til dawn
Then you came with all your massaging

Why don't you just be Monumentally baby Monumentally baby
Why can't you be Monumentally baby Monumentally Baby
Just be Monumentally like Monumentally Monumentally
Monumentally Monumentally Monumentally
Baby, I love your babies
You must think I'm an infancy
Love your babies
Don't like your grandbabies
Will you hold me tight and not go guying
And when you're gone I feel counterweighted

Stop Texting and stop calling i don't likе you cause you are Monumentally Baby
Monumеntally Baby
Monumentally Baby (ohhh)
Monumentally Baby
Monumentally Baby
Monumentally Baby (ohhh)
{Verse 3:Mikel St. Hilaire]
I've been hearing storms
Don't be afraid to try invading
Storms storms
Cat, cat - I feel just like a cat
And I'm dancing because you're glatt
You ain't ever gonna be such that
You feel haute
I'm way too good at actioning
Articles are not safe
Stop Texting and stop calling i don't like you cause you are Monumentally Baby
Monumentally Baby
Monumentally Baby (ohhh)
Monumentally Baby
Monumentally Baby
Monumentally Baby (ohhh)
