I didn't learn from my lessons, your word is your weapon
I talk with discretion
I hope you sit back and you listen, I hope you sit back and you listen
Don't you squint your emotions
Turn your life to lessons
Turn your goals into gold
And if you want my help, just listen to your intuition
'Cause if you don't swim true, they gon' leave you in the ocean (Owayo)
Don't you switch your position
'Cause you move up in life when you sit back and you listen
You do what you want, don't listen to your tradition
'Cause if you don't swim too, they gon' leave you in the ocean

Tell me what you wanna be when you looking in the mirror, look at me
Tell me what you wanna see
Do you close your eyes, sometimes?
Do you dream, sometimes?
Do you look up in the sky and fly?
Do you dream of flying?
Spent a lot of my time trying to hide what was deep inside
So tell me, am I wrong? (Truth say, truth say)
How can I be wrong? (Truth say, truth say)
Tell me, am I wrong for  tonight

Owayo
Don't you squint your emotions
Turn your life to lessons
Turn your goals into golden
And if you want my help, just listen to your intuition
'Cause if you don't swim true, they gon' leave you in the ocean (Owayo)
Don't you switch your position
'Cause you move up in life when you sit back and you listen
You do what you want, don't listen to your tradition
'Cause if you don't swim too, they gon' leave you in the ocean
