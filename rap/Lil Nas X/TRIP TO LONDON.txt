Where the bass, where the drummers at, come on with it
I'm out in London, niggas sayin' "He the one innit?"
Been needin' help to fold money, nothin' wrong with it
But lately I've been at McDonalds lookin' at the number five like
I'ma gon' get it
I'ma gon' fuck the game, she a thot, she a stain, she a number one spot so I'ma gon' hit it
I put her up, put her down, she my dumbbell now
Beat her back out, eat her back out
She get backed out, she my cash cow
Swear to God I'm finna act out
Niggas must be crazy if thеy think I'm finna back down
Man, this shit too crazy, tell the DJ run it back now
Eeniе Meenie Miney Mo
Balmain steppers on my toes
I told my driver get the Rolls
My Peter Piper is pecking hoes
(What? Bro, you gotta hear this)
I ain't even lyin', we've been out flyin' on up (Yeah)
Could've been on sidewalks, sleepin' in the night, oh yeah (Yeah)
I could be starvin', I could be dyin' on you (Yeah)
Gotta thank God that we ain't never down on luck
We ain't never down on-

We here to party, these niggas wanna get rid of us
They see potential, these niggas is gettin' scared of us
To say I do it for the money's disingenuous
A rich nigga with no dream is fuckin' penniless
Walk in the hotel room, that shit so big that- wait
(Where'd that shit go?)
My whole flow just got lost in that bitch
It's so big, I could build a family house in that bitch
Build a field and throw the ball to Randy Moss in that bitch
I want that Hershey
I want that black bottom bull boy to hurt me
I'm tryna hit the back room and bump purses
I'm thanking God, I can afford to be this thirsty
I'm thanking God, I can afford to be this-

I ain't even lyin', we've been out flyin' on up (Yea)
Could've been on sidewalks, sleepin' in the night, oh yea (Yea)
I could be starvin', I could be dyin' on you (Yea)
Gotta thank God that we ain't never down on luck
We ain't never down on luck
Down on luck
